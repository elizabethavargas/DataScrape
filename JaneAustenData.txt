b'\nI sent you a letter yesterday to Ibthorp, which\r\nI suppose you will not receive at Kintbury. It\r\nwas not very long or very witty, and therefore if\r\nyou never receive it, it does not much signify. I\r\nwrote principally to tell you that the Coopers were\r\narrived and in good health. The little boy is very\r\nlike Dr. Cooper, and the little girl is to resemble\r\nJane, they say.\nOur party to Ashe to-morrow night will consist\r\nof Edward Cooper, James (for a ball is nothing\r\nwithout him), Buller, who is now staying with us,\r\nand I. I look forward with great impatience to it,\r\nas I rather expect to receive an offer from my\r\nfriend in the course of the evening. I shall refuse\r\nhim, however, unless he promises to give away his\r\nwhite coat.\nI am very much flattered by your commendation\r\nof my last letter, for I write only for fame, and\r\nwithout any view to pecuniary emolument.\nEdward is gone to spend the day with his friend,\r\nJohn Lyford, and does not return till to-morrow.\r\nAnna is now here; she came up in her chaise to\r\nspend the day with her young cousins, but she does\r\nnot much take to them or to anything about them,\r\nexcept Caroline\'s spinning-wheel. I am very glad\r\nto find from Mary that Mr. and Mrs. Fowle are\r\npleased with you. I hope you will continue to\r\ngive satisfaction.\nHow impertinent you are to write to me about\r\nTom, as if I had not opportunities of hearing from\r\nhim myself! The last letter that I received from\r\nhim was dated on Friday, 8th, and he told me that\r\nif the wind should be favorable on Sunday, which\r\nit proved to be, they were to sail from Falmouth\r\non that day. By this time, therefore, they are at\r\nBarbadoes, I suppose. The Rivers are still at\r\nManydown, and are to be at Ashe to-morrow. I intended\r\nto call on the Miss Biggs yesterday had the\r\nweather been tolerable. Caroline, Anna, and I have\r\njust been devouring some cold souse, and it would\r\nbe difficult to say which enjoyed it most.\nTell Mary that I make over Mr. Heartley and\r\nall his estate to her for her sole use and benefit in\r\nfuture, and not only him, but all my other admirers\r\ninto the bargain wherever she can find them, even\r\nthe kiss which C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I\r\nmean to confine myself in future to Mr. Tom Lefroy,\r\nfor whom I don\'t care sixpence. Assure her also,\r\nas a last and indubitable proof of Warren\'s indifference\r\nto me, that he actually drew that gentleman\'s\r\npicture for me, and delivered it to me\r\nwithout a sigh.\nFriday.\xe2\x80\x94At length the day is come on which I\r\nam to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy, and when you\r\nreceive this it will be over. My tears flow as I\r\nwrite at the melancholy idea. Wm. Chute called\r\nhere yesterday. I wonder what he means by\r\nbeing so civil. There is a report that Tom is\r\ngoing to be married to a Lichfield lass. John\r\nLyford and his sister bring Edward home to-day,\r\ndine with us, and we shall all go together to Ashe.\r\nI understand that we are to draw for partners. I\r\nshall be extremely impatient to hear from you\r\nagain, that I may know how Eliza is, and when\r\nyou are to return.\nWith best love, etc., I am affectionately yours,\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Here I am once more\r\nin this scene of dissipation and vice, and I begin\r\nalready to find my morals corrupted. We reached\r\nStaines yesterday, I do not (know) when, without\r\nsuffering so much from the heat as I had hoped to\r\ndo. We set off again this morning at seven o\'clock,\r\nand had a very pleasant drive, as the morning was\r\ncloudy and perfectly cool. I came all the way in\r\nthe chaise from Hertford Bridge.\nEdward and Frank are both gone out to seek\r\ntheir fortunes; the latter is to return soon and\r\nhelp us seek ours. The former we shall never see\r\nagain. We are to be at Astley\'s to-night, which I\r\nam glad of. Edward has heard from Henry this\r\nmorning. He has not been at the races at all,\r\nunless his driving Miss Pearson over to Rowling\r\none day can be so called. We shall find him there\r\non Thursday.\nI hope you are all alive after our melancholy\r\nparting yesterday, and that you pursued your intended\r\navocation with success. God bless you! I\r\nmust leave off, for we are going out.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I shall be extremely\r\nanxious to hear the event of your ball, and shall hope\r\nto receive so long and minute an account of every\r\nparticular that I shall be tired of reading it. Let\r\nme know how many, besides their fourteen selves\r\nand Mr. and Mrs. Wright, Michael will contrive\r\nto place about their coach, and how many of the\r\ngentlemen, musicians, and waiters he will have\r\npersuaded to come in their shooting-jackets. I\r\nhope John Lovett\'s accident will not prevent his\r\nattending the ball, as you will otherwise be\r\nobliged to dance with Mr. Tincton the whole evening.\r\nLet me know how J. Harwood deports\r\nhimself without the Miss Biggs, and which of\r\nthe Marys will carry the day with my brother\r\nJames.\nWe were at a ball on Saturday, I assure you.\r\nWe dined at Goodnestone, and in the evening\r\ndanced two country-dances and the Boulangeries.\r\nI opened the ball with Edward Bridges; the other\r\ncouples were Lewis Cage and Harriet, Frank and\r\nLouisa, Fanny and George. Elizabeth played one\r\ncountry-dance, Lady Bridges the other, which she\r\nmade Henry dance with her, and Miss Finch\r\nplayed the Boulangeries.\nIn reading over the last three or four lines, I\r\nam aware of my having expressed myself in so\r\ndoubtful a manner that if I did not tell you to the\r\ncontrary, you might imagine it was Lady Bridges\r\nwho made Henry dance with her at the same time\r\nthat she was playing, which, if not impossible,\r\nmust appear a very improbable event to you. But\r\nit was Elizabeth who danced. We supped there,\r\nand walked home at night under the shade of two\r\numbrellas.\nTo-day the Goodnestone party begins to disperse\r\nand spread itself abroad. Mr. and Mrs. Cage and\r\nGeorge repair to Hythe. Lady Waltham, Miss\r\nBridges, and Miss Mary Finch to Dover, for the\r\nhealth of the two former. I have never seen\r\nMarianne at all. On Thursday Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBridges return to Danbury; Miss Harriet Hales\r\naccompanies them to London on her way to\r\nDorsetshire.\nFarmer Claringbould died this morning, and I\r\nfancy Edward means to get some of his farm, if\r\nhe can cheat Sir Brook enough in the agreement.\nWe have just got some venison from Godmersham,\r\nwhich the two Mr. Harveys are to dine on\r\nto-morrow, and on Friday or Saturday the Goodnestone\r\npeople are to finish their scraps. Henry\r\nwent away on Friday, as he purposed, without\r\nfayl. You will hear from him soon, I imagine, as\r\nhe talked of writing to Steventon shortly. Mr.\r\nRichard Harvey is going to be married; but as it\r\nis a great secret, and only known to half the\r\nneighborhood, you must not mention it. The\r\nlady\'s name is Musgrave.\nI am in great distress. I cannot determine\r\nwhether I shall give Richis half a guinea or only\r\nfive shillings when I go away. Counsel me, amiable\r\nMiss Austen, and tell me which will be the\r\nmost.\nWe walked Frank last night to Crixhall Ruff,\r\nand he appeared much edified. Little Edward\r\nwas breeched yesterday for good and all, and was\r\nwhipped into the bargain.\nPray remember me to everybody who does not\r\ninquire after me; those who do, remember me\r\nwithout bidding. Give my love to Mary Harrison,\r\nand tell her I wish, whenever she is attached\r\nto a young man, some respectable Dr. Marchmont\r\nmay keep them apart for five volumes....\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94We have been very gay\r\nsince I wrote last; dining at Nackington, returning\r\nby moonlight, and everything quite in style,\r\nnot to mention Mr. Claringbould\'s funeral which\r\nwe saw go by on Sunday. I believe I told you in\r\na former letter that Edward had some idea of taking\r\nthe name of Claringbould; but that scheme is\r\nover, though it would be a very eligible as well as\r\na very pleasant plan, would any one advance him\r\nmoney enough to begin on. We rather expected\r\nMr. Milles to have done so on Tuesday; but to our\r\ngreat surprise nothing was said on the subject, and\r\nunless it is in your power to assist your brother\r\nwith five or six hundred pounds, he must entirely\r\ngive up the idea.\nAt Nackington we met Lady Sondes\' picture\r\nover the mantelpiece in the dining-room, and the\r\npictures of her three children in an ante-room, besides\r\nMr. Scott, Miss Fletcher, Mr. Toke, Mr. J.\r\nToke, and the archdeacon Lynch. Miss Fletcher\r\nand I were very thick, but I am the thinnest of\r\nthe two. She wore her purple muslin, which is\r\npretty enough, though it does not become her complexion.\r\nThere are two traits in her character\r\nwhich are pleasing,\xe2\x80\x94namely, she admires Camilla,\r\nand drinks no cream in her tea. If you\r\nshould ever see Lucy, you may tell her that I\r\nscolded Miss Fletcher for her negligence in writing,\r\nas she desired me to do, but without being\r\nable to bring her to any proper sense of shame,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nMiss Fletcher says, in her defence, that as\r\neverybody whom Lucy knew when she was in\r\nCanterbury has now left it, she has nothing at\r\nall to write to her about. By everybody, I suppose\r\nMiss Fletcher means that a new set of officers\r\nhave arrived there. But this is a note of\r\nmy own.\nMrs. Milles, Mr. John Toke, and in short everybody\r\nof any sensibility inquired in tender strains\r\nafter you, and I took an opportunity of assuring\r\nMr. J. T. that neither he nor his father need\r\nlonger keep themselves single for you.\nWe went in our two carriages to Nackington;\r\nbut how we divided I shall leave you to surmise,\r\nmerely observing that as Elizabeth and I were\r\nwithout either hat or bonnet, it would not have\r\nbeen very convenient for us to go in the chaise.\r\nWe went by Bifrons, and I contemplated with a\r\nmelancholy pleasure the abode of him on whom I\r\nonce fondly doated. We dine to-day at Goodnestone,\r\nto meet my aunt Fielding from Margate\r\nand a Mr. Clayton, her professed admirer\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast, so I imagine. Lady Bridges has received\r\nvery good accounts of Marianne, who is already\r\ncertainly the better for her bathing.\nSo His Royal Highness Sir Thomas Williams\r\nhas at length sailed; the papers say "on a cruise."\r\nBut I hope they are gone to Cork, or I shall have\r\nwritten in vain. Give my love to Jane, as she\r\narrived at Steventon yesterday, I dare say.\nI sent a message to Mr. Digweed from Edward\r\nin a letter to Mary Lloyd which she ought to receive\r\nto-day; but as I know that the Harwoods are\r\nnot very exact as to their letters, I may as well\r\nrepeat it to you. Mr. Digweed is to be informed\r\nthat illness has prevented Seward\'s coming over\r\nto look at the repairs intended at the farm, but\r\nthat he will come as soon as he can. Mr. Digweed\r\nmay also be informed, if you think proper, that\r\nMr. and Mrs. Milles are to dine here to-morrow,\r\nand that Mrs. Joan Knatchbull is to be asked to\r\nmeet them. Mr. Richard Harvey\'s match is put\r\noff till he has got a better Christian name, of\r\nwhich he has great hopes.\nMr. Children\'s two sons are both going to be\r\nmarried, John and George. They are to have one\r\nwife between them, a Miss Holwell, who belongs\r\nto the Black Hole at Calcutta. I depend on hearing\r\nfrom James very soon; he promised me an\r\naccount of the ball, and by this time he must have\r\ncollected his ideas enough after the fatigue of\r\ndancing to give me one.\nEdward and Fly went out yesterday very early\r\nin a couple of shooting jackets, and came home\r\nlike a couple of bad shots, for they killed nothing\r\nat all. They are out again to-day, and are\r\nnot yet returned. Delightful sport! They are\r\njust come home, Edward with his two brace,\r\nFrank with his two and a half. What amiable\r\nyoung men!\nFriday.\xe2\x80\x94Your letter and one from Henry are\r\njust come, and the contents of both accord with\r\nmy scheme more than I had dared expect. In one\r\nparticular I could wish it otherwise, for Henry is\r\nvery indifferent indeed. You must not expect us\r\nquite so early, however, as Wednesday, the 20th,\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nthat day se\'nnight, according to our present\r\nplan, we may be with you. Frank had never any\r\nidea of going away before Monday, the 26th. I\r\nshall write to Miss Mason immediately, and press\r\nher returning with us, which Henry thinks very\r\nlikely, and particularly eligible.\nBuy Mary Harrison\'s gown by all means. You\r\nshall have mine for ever so much money, though,\r\nif I am tolerably rich when I get home, I shall\r\nlike it very much myself.\nAs to the mode of our travelling to town, I\r\nwant to go in a stage-coach, but Frank will not let\r\nme. As you are likely to have the Williams and\r\nLloyds with you next week, you would hardly find\r\nroom for us then. If any one wants anything in\r\ntown, they must send their commissions to Frank,\r\nas I shall merely pass through it. The tallow-chandler\r\nis Penlington, at the Crown and Beehive,\r\nCharles Street, Covent Garden.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94This morning has\r\nbeen spent in doubt and deliberation, in forming\r\nplans and removing difficulties, for it ushered in\r\nthe day with an event which I had not intended\r\nshould take place so soon by a week. Frank has\r\nreceived his appointment on board the "Captain\r\nJohn Gore," commanded by the "Triton," and will\r\ntherefore be obliged to be in town on Wednesday;\r\nand though I have every disposition in the world\r\nto accompany him on that day, I cannot go on the\r\nuncertainty of the Pearsons being at home, as I\r\nshould not have a place to go to in case they were\r\nfrom home.\nI wrote to Miss P. on Friday, and hoped to receive\r\nan answer from her this morning, which\r\nwould have rendered everything smooth and easy,\r\nand would have enabled us to leave this place to-morrow,\r\nas Frank, on first receiving his appointment,\r\nintended to do. He remains till Wednesday\r\nmerely to accommodate me. I have written to her\r\nagain to-day, and desired her to answer it by return\r\nof post. On Tuesday, therefore, I shall positively\r\nknow whether they can receive me on\r\nWednesday. If they cannot, Edward has been so\r\ngood as to promise to take me to Greenwich on the\r\nMonday following, which was the day before fixed\r\non, if that suits them better. If I have no answer\r\nat all on Tuesday, I must suppose Mary\r\nis not at home, and must wait till I do hear, as\r\nafter having invited her to go to Steventon with\r\nme, it will not quite do to go home and say no\r\nmore about it.\nMy father will be so good as to fetch home his\r\nprodigal daughter from town, I hope, unless he\r\nwishes me to walk the hospitals, enter at the\r\nTemple, or mount guard at St. James\'. It will\r\nhardly be in Frank\'s power to take me home,\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nit certainly will not. I shall write again as\r\nsoon as I get to Greenwich.\nWhat dreadful hot weather we have! It keeps\r\none in a continual state of inelegance.\nIf Miss Pearson should return with me, pray be\r\ncareful not to expect too much beauty. I will not\r\npretend to say that on a first view she quite\r\nanswered the opinion I had formed of her. My\r\nmother, I am sure, will be disappointed if she does\r\nnot take great care. From what I remember of\r\nher picture, it is no great resemblance.\nI am very glad that the idea of returning\r\nwith Frank occurred to me; for as to Henry\'s\r\ncoming into Kent again, the time of its taking\r\nplace is so very uncertain that I should be waiting\r\nfor dead men\'s shoes. I had once determined to go\r\nwith Frank to-morrow and take my chance, etc.,\r\nbut they dissuaded me from so rash a step as I\r\nreally think on consideration it would have been;\r\nfor if the Pearsons were not at home, I should\r\ninevitably fall a sacrifice to the arts of some fat\r\nwoman who would make me drunk with small\r\nbeer.\nMary is brought to bed of a boy,\xe2\x80\x94both doing\r\nvery well. I shall leave you to guess what Mary\r\nI mean. Adieu, with best love to all your agreeable\r\ninmates. Don\'t let the Lloyds go on any\r\naccount before I return, unless Miss P. is of the\r\nparty. How ill I have written! I begin to hate\r\nmyself.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94You have already\r\nheard from Daniel, I conclude, in what excellent\r\ntime we reached and quitted Sittingbourne, and\r\nhow very well my mother bore her journey thither.\r\nI am now able to send you a continuation of the\r\nsame good account of her. She was very little\r\nfatigued on her arrival at this place, has been\r\nrefreshed by a comfortable dinner, and now seems\r\nquite stout. It wanted five minutes of twelve\r\nwhen we left Sittingbourne, from whence we had\r\na famous pair of horses, which took us to Rochester\r\nin an hour and a quarter; the postboy seemed determined\r\nto show my mother that Kentish drivers\r\nwere not always tedious, and really drove as fast\r\nas Cax.\nOur next stage was not quite so expeditiously\r\nperformed; the road was heavy, and our horses very\r\nindifferent. However, we were in such good time\r\nand my mother bore her journey so well, that expedition\r\nwas of little importance to us; and as it\r\nwas, we were very little more than two hours and\r\na half coming hither, and it was scarcely past\r\nfour when we stopped at the inn. My mother\r\ntook some of her bitters at Ospringe, and some\r\nmore at Rochester, and she ate some bread several\r\ntimes.\nWe have got apartments up two pair of stairs,\r\nas we could not be otherwise accommodated with\r\na sitting-room and bed-chambers on the same floor\r\nwhich we wished to be. We have one double-bedded\r\nand one single-bedded room; in the former\r\nmy mother and I are to sleep. I shall leave you to\r\nguess who is to occupy the other. We sate down\r\nto dinner a little after five, and had some beef-steaks\r\nand a boiled fowl, but no oyster sauce.\nI should have begun my letter soon after our\r\narrival, but for a little adventure which prevented\r\nme. After we had been here a quarter of an hour\r\nit was discovered that my writing and dressing\r\nboxes had been by accident put into a chaise\r\nwhich was just packing off as we came in, and\r\nwere driven away toward Gravesend in their way\r\nto the West Indies. No part of my property could\r\nhave been such a prize before, for in my writing-box\r\nwas all my worldly wealth, 7l., and my dear\r\nHarry\'s deputation. Mr. Nottley immediately despatched\r\na man and horse after the chaise, and in\r\nhalf an hour\'s time I had the pleasure of being as\r\nrich as ever; they were got about two or three\r\nmiles off.\nMy day\'s journey has been pleasanter in every\r\nrespect than I expected. I have been very little\r\ncrowded and by no means unhappy. Your watchfulness\r\nwith regard to the weather on our accounts\r\nwas very kind and very effectual. We had one\r\nheavy shower on leaving Sittingbourne, but afterwards\r\nthe clouds cleared away, and we had a very\r\nbright chrystal afternoon.\nMy father is now reading the "Midnight Bell,"\r\nwhich he has got from the library, and mother\r\nsitting by the fire. Our route to-morrow is not\r\ndetermined. We have none of us much inclination\r\nfor London, and if Mr. Nottley will give us leave,\r\nI think we shall go to Staines through Croydon\r\nand Kingston, which will be much pleasanter than\r\nany other way; but he is decidedly for Clapham\r\nand Battersea. God bless you all!\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Your letter was a\r\nmost agreeable surprise to me to-day, and I have\r\ntaken a long sheet of paper to show my gratitude.\nWe arrived here yesterday between four and\r\nfive, but I cannot send you quite so triumphant an\r\naccount of our last day\'s journey as of the first\r\nand second. Soon after I had finished my letter\r\nfrom Staines, my mother began to suffer from the\r\nexercise or fatigue of travelling, and she was a\r\ngood deal indisposed. She had not a very good\r\nnight at Staines, but bore her journey better than\r\nI had expected, and at Basingstoke, where we\r\nstopped more than half an hour, received much\r\ncomfort from a mess of broth and the sight of\r\nMr. Lyford, who recommended her to take twelve\r\ndrops of laudanum when she went to bed as a\r\ncomposer, which she accordingly did.\nJames called on us just as we were going to tea,\r\nand my mother was well enough to talk very cheerfully\r\nto him before she went to bed. James seems\r\nto have taken to his old trick of coming to Steventon\r\nin spite of Mary\'s reproaches, for he was here\r\nbefore breakfast and is now paying us a second\r\nvisit. They were to have dined here to-day, but\r\nthe weather is too bad. I have had the pleasure\r\nof hearing that Martha is with them. James\r\nfetched her from Ibthorp on Thursday, and she\r\nwill stay with them till she removes to Kintbury.\nWe met with no adventures at all in our journey\r\nyesterday, except that our trunk had once nearly\r\nslipped off, and we were obliged to stop at Hartley\r\nto have our wheels greased.\nWhilst my mother and Mr. Lyford were together\r\nI went to Mrs. Ryder\'s and bought what I intended\r\nto buy, but not in much perfection. There were\r\nno narrow braces for children, and scarcely any\r\nnotting silk; but Miss Wood, as usual, is going to\r\ntown very soon, and will lay in a fresh stock. I\r\ngave 2s. 3d. a yard for my flannel, and I fancy it\r\nis not very good, but it is so disgraceful and contemptible\r\nan article in itself that its being comparatively\r\ngood or bad is of little importance.\r\nI bought some Japan ink likewise, and next week\r\nshall begin my operations on my hat, on which you\r\nknow my principal hopes of happiness depend.\nI am very grand indeed; I had the dignity of\r\ndropping out my mother\'s laudanum last night. I\r\ncarry about the keys of the wine and closet, and\r\ntwice since I began this letter have had orders to\r\ngive in the kitchen. Our dinner was very good\r\nyesterday, and the chicken boiled perfectly tender;\r\ntherefore I shall not be obliged to dismiss Nanny\r\non that account.\nAlmost everything was unpacked and put away\r\nlast night. Nanny chose to do it, and I was not\r\nsorry to be busy. I have unpacked the gloves, and\r\nplaced yours in your drawer. Their color is light\r\nand pretty, and I believe exactly what we fixed on.\nYour letter was chaperoned here by one from\r\nMrs. Cooke, in which she says that "Battleridge"\r\nis not to come out before January, and she is so\r\nlittle satisfied with Cawthorn\'s dilatoriness that\r\nshe never means to employ him again.\nMrs. Hall, of Sherborne, was brought to bed\r\nyesterday of a dead child, some weeks before she\r\nexpected, owing to a fright. I suppose she happened\r\nunawares to look at her husband.\nThere has been a great deal of rain here for this\r\nlast fortnight, much more than in Kent, and indeed\r\nwe found the roads all the way from Staines\r\nmost disgracefully dirty. Steventon lane has its\r\nfull share of it, and I don\'t know when I shall be\r\nable to get to Deane.\nI hear that Martha is in better looks and spirits\r\nthan she has enjoyed for a long time, and I flatter\r\nmyself she will now be able to jest openly about\r\nMr. W.\nThe spectacles which Molly found are my\r\nmother\'s, the scissors my father\'s. We are very\r\nglad to hear such a good account of your patients,\r\nlittle and great. My dear itty Dordy\'s remembrance\r\nof me is very pleasing to me,\xe2\x80\x94foolishly\r\npleasing, because I know it will be over so soon.\r\nMy attachment to him will be more durable. I\r\nshall think with tenderness and delight on his\r\nbeautiful and smiling countenance and interesting\r\nmanner until a few years have turned him into an\r\nungovernable, ungracious fellow.\nThe books from Winton are all unpacked and\r\nput away; the binding has compressed them most\r\nconveniently, and there is now very good room in\r\nthe bookcase for all that we wish to have there.\r\nI believe the servants were very glad to see us\r\nNanny was, I am sure. She confesses that it was\r\nvery dull, and yet she had her child with her till\r\nlast Sunday. I understand that there are some\r\ngrapes left, but I believe not many; they must be\r\ngathered as soon as possible, or this rain will\r\nentirely rot them.\nI am quite angry with myself for not writing\r\ncloser; why is my alphabet so much more sprawly\r\nthan yours? Dame Tilbury\'s daughter has lain in.\r\nShall I give her any of your baby clothes? The\r\nlaceman was here only a few days ago. How\r\nunfortunate for both of us that he came so soon!\r\nDame Bushell washes for us only one week more,\r\nas Sukey has got a place. John Steevens\' wife\r\nundertakes our purification. She does not look as\r\nif anything she touched would ever be clean, but\r\nwho knows? We do not seem likely to have any\r\nother maidservant at present, but Dame Staples\r\nwill supply the place of one. Mary has hired a\r\nyoung girl from Ashe who has never been out to\r\nservice to be her scrub, but James fears her not\r\nbeing strong enough for the place.\nEarle Harwood has been to Deane lately, as I\r\nthink Mary wrote us word, and his family then told\r\nhim that they would receive his wife, if she continued\r\nto behave well for another year. He was\r\nvery grateful, as well he might; their behavior\r\nthroughout the whole affair has been particularly\r\nkind. Earle and his wife live in the most private\r\nmanner imaginable at Portsmouth, without keeping\r\na servant of any kind. What a prodigious innate\r\nlove of virtue she must have, to marry under such\r\ncircumstances!\nIt is now Saturday evening, but I wrote the\r\nchief of this in the morning. My mother has not\r\nbeen down at all to-day; the laudanum made her\r\nsleep a good deal, and upon the whole I think she\r\nis better. My father and I dined by ourselves.\r\nHow strange! He and John Bond are now very\r\nhappy together, for I have just heard the heavy\r\nstep of the latter along the passage.\nJames Digweed called to-day, and I gave him\r\nhis brother\'s deputation. Charles Harwood, too,\r\nhas just called to ask how we are, in his way from\r\nDummer, whither he has been conveying Miss\r\nGarrett, who is going to return to her former\r\nresidence in Kent. I will leave off, or I shall not\r\nhave room to add a word to-morrow.\nSunday.\xe2\x80\x94My mother has had a very good\r\nnight, and feels much better to-day.\nI have received my aunt\'s letter, and thank\r\nyou for your scrap. I will write to Charles soon.\r\nPray give Fanny and Edward a kiss from me, and\r\nask George if he has got a new song for me. \'Tis\r\nreally very kind of my aunt to ask us to Bath\r\nagain; a kindness that deserves a better return\r\nthan to profit by it.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I am so good as to\r\nwrite to you again thus speedily, to let you know\r\nthat I have just heard from Frank. He was at\r\nCadiz, alive and well, on October 19, and had then\r\nvery lately received a letter from you, written as\r\nlong ago as when the "London" was at St.\r\nHelen\'s. But his raly latest intelligence of us\r\nwas in one from me of September 1, which I sent\r\nsoon after we got to Godmersham. He had written\r\na packet full for his dearest friends in England,\r\nearly in October, to go by the "Excellent;" but\r\nthe "Excellent" was not sailed, nor likely to\r\nsail, when he despatched this to me. It comprehended\r\nletters for both of us, for Lord Spencer,\r\nMr. Daysh, and the East India Directors. Lord\r\nSt. Vincent had left the fleet when he wrote, and\r\nwas gone to Gibraltar, it was said to superintend\r\nthe fitting out of a private expedition from thence\r\nagainst some of the enemies\' ports; Minorca or\r\nMalta were conjectured to be the objects.\nFrank writes in good spirits, but says that our\r\ncorrespondence cannot be so easily carried on in\r\nfuture as it has been, as the communication between\r\nCadiz and Lisbon is less frequent than\r\nformerly. You and my mother, therefore, must\r\nnot alarm yourselves at the long intervals that\r\nmay divide his letters. I address this advice to\r\nyou two as being the most tender-hearted of the\r\nfamily.\nMy mother made her entr\xc3\xa9e into the dressing-room\r\nthrough crowds of admiring spectators yesterday\r\nafternoon, and we all drank tea together\r\nfor the first time these five weeks. She has had a\r\ntolerable night, and bids fair for a continuance in\r\nthe same brilliant course of action to-day....\nMr. Lyford was here yesterday; he came while\r\nwe were at dinner, and partook of our elegant\r\nentertainment. I was not ashamed at asking him\r\nto sit down to table, for we had some pease-soup,\r\na sparerib, and a pudding. He wants my mother\r\nto look yellow and to throw out a rash, but she\r\nwill do neither.\nI was at Deane yesterday morning. Mary was\r\nvery well, but does not gain bodily strength very\r\nfast. When I saw her so stout on the third and\r\nsixth days, I expected to have seen her as well as\r\never by the end of a fortnight.\nJames went to Ibthorp yesterday to see his\r\nmother and child. Letty is with Mary at present,\r\nof course exceedingly happy, and in raptures with\r\nthe child. Mary does not manage matters in such\r\na way as to make me want to lay in myself. She\r\nis not tidy enough in her appearance; she has no\r\ndressing-gown to sit up in; her curtains are all too\r\nthin, and things are not in that comfort and style\r\nabout her which are necessary to make such a\r\nsituation an enviable one. Elizabeth was really a\r\npretty object with her nice clean cap put on so\r\ntidily and her dress so uniformly white and orderly.\r\nWe live entirely in the dressing-room now, which\r\nI like very much; I always feel so much more\r\nelegant in it than in the parlor.\nNo news from Kintbury yet. Eliza sports with\r\nour impatience. She was very well last Thursday.\r\nWho is Miss Maria Montresor going to marry, and\r\nwhat is to become of Miss Mulcaster?\nI find great comfort in my stuff gown, but I\r\nhope you do not wear yours too often. I have\r\nmade myself two or three caps to wear of evenings\r\nsince I came home, and they save me a world of\r\ntorment as to hairdressing, which at present gives\r\nme no trouble beyond washing and brushing, for\r\nmy long hair is always plaited up out of sight, and\r\nmy short hair curls well enough to want no papering.\r\nI have had it cut lately by Mr. Butler.\nThere is no reason to suppose that Miss Morgan\r\nis dead after all. Mr. Lyford gratified us very\r\nmuch yesterday by his praises of my father\'s\r\nmutton, which they all think the finest that was\r\never ate. John Bond begins to find himself grow\r\nold, which John Bonds ought not to do, and unequal\r\nto much hard work; a man is therefore\r\nhired to supply his place as to labor, and John\r\nhimself is to have the care of the sheep. There\r\nare not more people engaged than before, I believe;\r\nonly men instead of boys. I fancy so at least, but\r\nyou know my stupidity as to such matters. Lizzie\r\nBond is just apprenticed to Miss Small, so we may\r\nhope to see her able to spoil gowns in a few\r\nyears.\nMy father has applied to Mr. May for an ale-house\r\nfor Robert, at his request, and to Mr. Deane,\r\nof Winchester, likewise. This was my mother\'s\r\nidea, who thought he would be proud to oblige a\r\nrelation of Edward in return for Edward\'s accepting\r\nhis money. He sent a very civil answer indeed,\r\nbut has no house vacant at present. May expects\r\nto have an empty one soon at Farnham, so perhaps\r\nNanny may have the honor of drawing ale for the\r\nBishop. I shall write to Frank to-morrow.\nCharles Powlett gave a dance on Thursday, to\r\nthe great disturbance of all his neighbors, of\r\ncourse, who, you know, take a most lively interest\r\nin the state of his finances, and live in hopes of\r\nhis being soon ruined.\nWe are very much disposed to like our new\r\nmaid; she knows nothing of a dairy, to be sure,\r\nwhich, in our family, is rather against her, but she\r\nis to be taught it all. In short, we have felt the\r\ninconvenience of being without a maid so long,\r\nthat we are determined to like her, and she will\r\nfind it a hard matter to displease us. As yet, she\r\nseems to cook very well, is uncommonly stout, and\r\nsays she can work well at her needle.\nSunday.\xe2\x80\x94My father is glad to hear so good an\r\naccount of Edward\'s pigs, and desires he may be\r\ntold, as encouragement to his taste for them, that\r\nLord Bolton is particularly curious in his pigs, has\r\nhad pigstyes of a most elegant construction built\r\nfor them, and visits them every morning as soon\r\nas he rises.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Your letter came quite\r\nas soon as I expected, and so your letters will\r\nalways do, because I have made it a rule not to\r\nexpect them till they come, in which I think I\r\nconsult the ease of us both.\nIt is a great satisfaction to us to hear that your\r\nbusiness is in a way to be settled, and so settled\r\nas to give you as little inconvenience as possible.\r\nYou are very welcome to my father\'s name and to\r\nhis services if they are ever required in it. I\r\nshall keep my ten pounds too, to wrap myself up\r\nin next winter.\n\nI took the liberty a few days ago of asking your\r\nblack velvet bonnet to lend me its cawl, which it\r\nvery readily did, and by which I have been enabled\r\nto give a considerable improvement of dignity to cap,\r\nwhich was before too nidgetty to please me. I\r\nshall wear it on Thursday, but I hope you will not\r\nbe offended with me for following your advice as\r\nto its ornaments only in part. I still venture to\r\nretain the narrow silver round it, put twice round\r\nwithout any bow, and instead of the black military\r\nfeather shall put in the coquelicot one as being\r\nsmarter, and besides coquelicot is to be all the\r\nfashion this winter. After the ball I shall probably\r\nmake it entirely black.\nI am sorry that our dear Charles begins to feel\r\nthe dignity of ill-usage. My father will write to\r\nAdmiral Gambier. He must have already received\r\nso much satisfaction from his acquaintance\r\nand patronage of Frank, that he will be delighted,\r\nI dare say, to have another of the family introduced\r\nto him. I think it would be very right in\r\nCharles to address Sir Thomas on the occasion,\r\nthough I cannot approve of your scheme of writing\r\nto him (which you communicated to me a few\r\nnights ago) to request him to come home and convey\r\nyou to Steventon. To do you justice, however,\r\nyou had some doubts of the propriety of such\r\na measure yourself.\nI am very much obliged to my dear little George\r\nfor his message,\xe2\x80\x94for his love at least; his duty,\r\nI suppose, was only in consequence of some hint\r\nof my favorable intentions towards him from his\r\nfather or mother. I am sincerely rejoiced, however,\r\nthat I ever was born, since it has been the\r\nmeans of procuring him a dish of tea. Give my\r\nbest love to him....\nWednesday.\xe2\x80\x94I have changed my mind, and\r\nchanged the trimmings of my cap this morning;\r\nthey are now such as you suggested. I felt as if\r\nI should not prosper if I strayed from your directions,\r\nand I think it makes me look more like Lady\r\nConyngham now than it did before, which is all\r\nthat one lives for now. I believe I shall make my\r\nnew gown like my robe, but the back of the latter\r\nis all in a piece with the tail, and will seven yards\r\nenable me to copy it in that respect?\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\nI have just heard from Martha and Frank: his\r\nletter was written on November 12. All well and\r\nnothing particular.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I have got some pleasant\r\nnews for you which I am eager to communicate,\r\nand therefore begin my letter sooner, though\r\nI shall not send it sooner than usual.\n\nAdmiral Gambier, in reply to my father\'s application,\r\nwrites as follows: "As it is usual to\r\nkeep young officers in small vessels, it being most\r\nproper on account of their inexperience, and it\r\nbeing also a situation where they are more in the\r\nway of learning their duty, your son has been continued\r\nin the \'Scorpion;\' but I have mentioned\r\nto the Board of Admiralty his wish to be in a\r\nfrigate, and when a proper opportunity offers and\r\nit is judged that he has taken his turn in a small\r\nship, I hope he will be removed. With regard to\r\nyour son now in the \'London\' I am glad I can\r\ngive you the assurance that his promotion is likely\r\nto take place very soon, as Lord Spencer has been\r\nso good as to say he would include him in an arrangement\r\nthat he proposes making in a short time\r\nrelative to some promotions in that quarter."\nThere! I may now finish my letter and go and\r\nhang myself, for I am sure I can neither write nor do\r\nanything which will not appear insipid to you after\r\nthis. Now I really think he will soon be made,\r\nand only wish we could communicate our foreknowledge\r\nof the event to him whom it principally\r\nconcerns. My father has written to Daysh to desire\r\nthat he will inform us, if he can, when the\r\ncommission is sent. Your chief wish is now ready\r\nto be accomplished; and could Lord Spencer give\r\nhappiness to Martha at the same time, what a joyful\r\nheart he would make of yours!\n\nI have sent the same extract of the sweets of\r\nGambier to Charles, who, poor fellow, though he\r\nsinks into nothing but an humble attendant on the\r\nhero of the piece, will, I hope, be contented with\r\nthe prospect held out to him. By what the Admiral\r\nsays, it appears as if he had been designedly\r\nkept in the "Scorpion." But I will not torment\r\nmyself with conjectures and suppositions; facts\r\nshall satisfy me.\nFrank had not heard from any of us for ten\r\nweeks when he wrote to me on November 12 in\r\nconsequence of Lord St. Vincent being removed to\r\nGibraltar. When his commission is sent, however,\r\nit will not be so long on its road as our letters,\r\nbecause all the Government despatches are\r\nforwarded by land to his lordship from Lisbon\r\nwith great regularity.\nI returned from Manydown this morning, and\r\nfound my mother certainly in no respect worse\r\nthan when I left her. She does not like the cold\r\nweather, but that we cannot help. I spent my\r\ntime very quietly and very pleasantly with Catherine.\r\nMiss Blackford is agreeable enough. I do\r\nnot want people to be very agreeable, as it saves\r\nme the trouble of liking them a great deal. I\r\nfound only Catherine and her when I got to\r\nManydown on Thursday. We dined together, and\r\nwent together to Worting to seek the protection of\r\nMrs. Clarke, with whom were Lady Mildmay, her\r\neldest son, and Mr. and Mrs. Hoare.\n\nOur ball was very thin, but by no means unpleasant.\r\nThere were thirty-one people, and only\r\neleven ladies out of the number, and but five\r\nsingle women in the room. Of the gentlemen\r\npresent you may have some idea from the list of\r\nmy partners,\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Wood, G. Lefroy, Rice, a Mr.\r\nButcher (belonging to the Temples, a sailor and\r\nnot of the 11th Light Dragoons), Mr. Temple (not\r\nthe horrid one of all), Mr. Wm. Orde (cousin to\r\nthe Kingsclere man), Mr. John Harwood, and\r\nMr. Calland, who appeared as usual with his hat\r\nin his hand, and stood every now and then behind\r\nCatherine and me to be talked to and abused for\r\nnot dancing. We teased him, however, into it at\r\nlast. I was very glad to see him again after so\r\nlong a separation, and he was altogether rather\r\nthe genius and flirt of the evening. He inquired\r\nafter you.\nThere were twenty dances, and I danced them\r\nall, and without any fatigue. I was glad to find\r\nmyself capable of dancing so much, and with so\r\nmuch satisfaction as I did; from my slender enjoyment\r\nof the Ashford balls (as assemblies for dancing)\r\nI had not thought myself equal to it, but in\r\ncold weather and with few couples I fancy I could\r\njust as well dance for a week together as for half\r\nan hour. My black cap was openly admired by\r\nMrs. Lefroy, and secretly I imagine by everybody\r\nelse in the room....\n\nPoor Edward! It is very hard that he, who\r\nhas everything else in the world that he can wish\r\nfor, should not have good health too. But I hope\r\nwith the assistance of stomach complaints, faintnesses,\r\nand sicknesses, he will soon be restored to\r\nthat blessing likewise. If his nervous complaint\r\nproceeded from a suppression of something that\r\nought to be thrown out, which does not seem unlikely,\r\nthe first of these disorders may really be a\r\nremedy, and I sincerely wish it may, for I know\r\nno one more deserving of happiness without alloy\r\nthan Edward is....\nThe Lords of the Admiralty will have enough\r\nof our applications at present, for I hear from\r\nCharles that he has written to Lord Spencer himself\r\nto be removed. I am afraid his Serene Highness\r\nwill be in a passion, and order some of our\r\nheads to be cut off....\nYou deserve a longer letter than this; but it is\r\nmy unhappy fate seldom to treat people so well as\r\nthey deserve.... God bless you!\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Frank is made. He\r\nwas yesterday raised to the rank of Commander,\r\nand appointed to the "Petterel" sloop, now at\r\nGibraltar. A letter from Daysh has just announced\r\nthis, and as it is confirmed by a very\r\nfriendly one from Mr. Mathew to the same effect,\r\ntranscribing one from Admiral Gambier to the\r\nGeneral, we have no reason to suspect the truth\r\nof it.\nAs soon as you have cried a little for joy, you\r\nmay go on, and learn further that the India House\r\nhave taken Captain Austen\'s petition into consideration,\xe2\x80\x94this\r\ncomes from Daysh,\xe2\x80\x94and likewise\r\nthat Lieutenant Charles John Austen is\r\nremoved to the "Tamar" frigate,\xe2\x80\x94this comes\r\nfrom the Admiral. We cannot find out where the\r\n"Tamar" is, but I hope we shall now see Charles\r\nhere at all events.\nThis letter is to be dedicated entirely to good\r\nnews. If you will send my father an account of\r\nyour washing and letter expenses, etc., he will\r\nsend you a draft for the amount of it, as well as\r\nfor your next quarter, and for Edward\'s rent. If\r\nyou don\'t buy a muslin gown now on the strength\r\nof this money and Frank\'s promotion, I shall\r\nnever forgive you.\n\nMrs. Lefroy has just sent me word that Lady\r\nDorchester meant to invite me to her ball on\r\nJanuary 8, which, though an humble blessing\r\ncompared with what the last page records, I do\r\nnot consider as any calamity.\nI cannot write any more now, but I have written\r\nenough to make you very happy, and therefore\r\nmay safely conclude.\nMy Dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94You must read your\r\nletters over five times in future before you send\r\nthem, and then, perhaps, you may find them as\r\nentertaining as I do. I laughed at several parts\r\nof the one which I am now answering.\nCharles is not come yet, but he must come this\r\nmorning, or he shall never know what I will do\r\nto him. The ball at Kempshott is this evening,\r\nand I have got him an invitation, though I have\r\nnot been so considerate as to get him a partner.\r\nBut the cases are different between him and Eliza\r\nBailey, for he is not in a dying way, and may\r\ntherefore be equal to getting a partner for himself.\r\nI believe I told you that Monday was to be the\r\nball night, for which, and for all other errors into\r\nwhich I may ever have led you, I humbly ask\r\nyour pardon.\nElizabeth is very cruel about my writing music,\r\nand, as a punishment for her, I should insist upon\r\nalways writing out all hers for her in future, if I\r\nwere not punishing myself at the same time.\nI am tolerably glad to hear that Edward\'s income\r\nis so good a one,\xe2\x80\x94as glad as I can be at\r\nanybody\'s being rich except you and me,\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nam thoroughly rejoiced to hear of his present to\r\nyou.\nI am not to wear my white satin cap to-night,\r\nafter all; I am to wear a mamalone cap instead,\r\nwhich Charles Fowle sent to Mary, and which she\r\nlends me. It is all the fashion now; worn at the\r\nopera, and by Lady Mildmays at Hackwood balls.\r\nI hate describing such things, and I dare say you\r\nwill be able to guess what it is like. I have got\r\nover the dreadful epocha of mantua-making much\r\nbetter than I expected. My gown is made very\r\nmuch like my blue one, which you always told\r\nme sat very well, with only these variations: the\r\nsleeves are short, the wrap fuller, the apron comes\r\nover it, and a band of the same completes the\r\nwhole.\nI assure you that I dread the idea of going to\r\nBrighton as much as you do, but I am not without\r\nhopes that something may happen to prevent it.\nF\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 has lost his election at B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and perhaps\r\nthey may not be able to see company for\r\nsome time. They talk of going to Bath, too, in\r\nthe spring, and perhaps they may be overturned in\r\ntheir way down, and all laid up for the summer.\nWednesday.\xe2\x80\x94I have had a cold and weakness\r\nin one of my eyes for some days, which makes\r\nwriting neither very pleasant nor very profitable,\r\nand which will probably prevent my finishing this\r\nletter myself. My mother has undertaken to do\r\nit for me, and I shall leave the Kempshott ball\r\nfor her.\nYou express so little anxiety about my being\r\nmurdered under Ash Park Copse by Mrs. Hulbert\'s\r\nservant, that I have a great mind not to\r\ntell you whether I was or not, and shall only say\r\nthat I did not return home that night or the next,\r\nas Martha kindly made room for me in her bed,\r\nwhich was the shut-up one in the new nursery.\r\nNurse and the child slept upon the floor, and there\r\nwe all were in some confusion and great comfort.\r\nThe bed did exceedingly well for us, both to lie\r\nawake in and talk till two o\'clock, and to sleep in\r\nthe rest of the night. I love Martha better than\r\never, and I mean to go and see her, if I can, when\r\nshe gets home. We all dined at the Harwoods\' on\r\nThursday, and the party broke up the next morning.\nThis complaint in my eye has been a sad bore to\r\nme, for I have not been able to read or work in\r\nany comfort since Friday; but one advantage will\r\nbe derived from it, for I shall be such a proficient\r\nin music by the time I have got rid of my cold,\r\nthat I shall be perfectly qualified in that science\r\nat least to take Mr. Roope\'s office at Eastwell next\r\nsummer; and I am sure of Elizabeth\'s recommendation,\r\nbe it only on Harriet\'s account. Of my\r\ntalent in drawing I have given specimens in my\r\nletters to you, and I have nothing to do but to invent\r\na few hard names for the stars.\nMary grows rather more reasonable about her\r\nchild\'s beauty, and says that she does not think\r\nhim really handsome; but I suspect her moderation\r\nto be something like that of W\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 W\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\'s\r\nmamma. Perhaps Mary has told you that they are\r\ngoing to enter more into dinner-parties; the Biggs\r\nand Mr. Holder dine there to-morrow, and I am to\r\nmeet them. I shall sleep there. Catherine has\r\nthe honor of giving her name to a set, which will\r\nbe composed of two Withers, two Heathcotes, a\r\nBlackford, and no Bigg except herself. She congratulated\r\nme last night on Frank\'s promotion, as\r\nif she really felt the joy she talked of.\nMy sweet little George! I am delighted to hear\r\nthat he has such an inventive genius as to face-making.\r\nI admired his yellow wafer very much,\r\nand hope he will choose the wafer for your next\r\nletter. I wore my green shoes last night, and took\r\nmy white fan with me; I am very glad he never\r\nthrew it into the river.\n\nMrs. Knight giving up the Godmersham estate\r\nto Edward was no such prodigious act of generosity\r\nafter all, it seems, for she has reserved herself an\r\nincome out of it still; this ought to be known, that\r\nher conduct may not be overrated. I rather think\r\nEdward shows the most magnanimity of the two, in\r\naccepting her resignation with such incumbrances.\nThe more I write, the better my eye gets; so I\r\nshall at least keep on till it is quite well, before I\r\ngive up my pen to my mother.\nMrs. Bramston\'s little movable apartment was\r\ntolerably filled last night by herself, Mrs. H.\r\nBlackstone, her two daughters, and me. I do not\r\nlike the Miss Blackstones; indeed, I was always\r\ndetermined not to like them, so there is the less\r\nmerit in it. Mrs. Bramston was very civil, kind,\r\nand noisy. I spent a very pleasant evening,\r\nchiefly among the Manydown party. There was\r\nthe same kind of supper as last year, and the same\r\nwant of chairs. There were more dancers than the\r\nroom could conveniently hold, which is enough to\r\nconstitute a good ball at any time.\nI do not think I was very much in request.\r\nPeople were rather apt not to ask me till they\r\ncould not help it; one\'s consequence, you know,\r\nvaries so much at times without any particular\r\nreason. There was one gentleman, an officer of\r\nthe Cheshire, a very good-looking young man,\r\nwho, I was told, wanted very much to be introduced\r\nto me; but as he did not want it quite\r\nenough to take much trouble in effecting it, we\r\nnever could bring it about.\nI danced with Mr. John Wood again, twice with\r\na Mr. South, a lad from Winchester, who, I suppose,\r\nis as far from being related to the bishop of\r\nthat diocese as it is possible to be, with G. Lefroy,\r\nand J. Harwood, who, I think, takes to me rather\r\nmore than he used to do. One of my gayest actions\r\nwas sitting down two dances in preference\r\nto having Lord Bolton\'s eldest son for my partner,\r\nwho danced too ill to be endured. The Miss\r\nCharterises were there, and played the parts of\r\nthe Miss Edens with great spirit. Charles never\r\ncame. Naughty Charles! I suppose he could\r\nnot get superseded in time.\nMiss Debary has replaced your two sheets of\r\ndrawing-paper with two of superior size and quality;\r\nso I do not grudge her having taken them at\r\nall now. Mr. Ludlow and Miss Pugh of Andover\r\nare lately married, and so is Mrs. Skeete of Basingstoke,\r\nand Mr. French, chemist, of Reading.\nI do not wonder at your wanting to read "First\r\nImpressions" again, so seldom as you have gone\r\nthrough it, and that so long ago. I am much\r\nobliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat\r\nbehind you. I have long secretly wished it\r\nmight be done, but had not courage to make the\r\nrequest.\n\nPray mention the name of Maria Montresor\'s\r\nlover when you write next. My mother wants to\r\nknow it, and I have not courage to look back into\r\nyour letters to find it out.\nI shall not be able to send this till to-morrow,\r\nand you will be disappointed on Friday; I am very\r\nsorry for it, but I cannot help it.\nThe partnership between Jeffereys, Toomer, and\r\nLegge is dissolved; the two latter are melted away\r\ninto nothing, and it is to be hoped that Jeffereys\r\nwill soon break, for the sake of a few heroines\r\nwhose money he may have. I wish you joy of\r\nyour birthday twenty times over.\nI shall be able to send this to the post to-day,\r\nwhich exalts me to the utmost pinnacle of human\r\nfelicity, and makes me bask in the sunshine of\r\nprosperity or gives me any other sensation of pleasure\r\nin studied language which you may prefer.\r\nDo not be angry with me for not filling my sheet,\r\nand believe me yours affectionately,\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I will endeavor to\r\nmake this letter more worthy your acceptance\r\nthan my last, which was so shabby a one that I\r\nthink Mr. Marshall could never charge you with\r\nthe postage. My eyes have been very indifferent\r\nsince it was written, but are now getting better\r\nonce more; keeping them so many hours open on\r\nThursday night, as well as the dust of the ballroom,\r\ninjured them a good deal. I use them as little\r\nas I can, but you know, and Elizabeth knows,\r\nand everybody who ever had weak eyes knows,\r\nhow delightful it is to hurt them by employment,\r\nagainst the advice and entreaty of all one\'s friends.\nCharles leaves us to-night. The "Tamar" is in\r\nthe Downs, and Mr. Daysh advises him to join her\r\nthere directly, as there is no chance of her going\r\nto the westward. Charles does not approve of this\r\nat all, and will not be much grieved if he should\r\nbe too late for her before she sails, as he may then\r\nhope to get into a better station. He attempted\r\nto go to town last night, and got as far on his road\r\nthither as Dean Gate; but both the coaches were\r\nfull, and we had the pleasure of seeing him back\r\nagain. He will call on Daysh to-morrow to know\r\nwhether the "Tamar" has sailed or not, and if she\r\nis still at the Downs he will proceed in one of the\r\nnight coaches to Deal. I want to go with him,\r\nthat I may explain the country to him properly\r\nbetween Canterbury and Rowling, but the unpleasantness\r\nof returning by myself deters me. I\r\nshould like to go as far as Ospringe with him\r\nvery much indeed, that I might surprise you at\r\nGodmersham.\n\nMartha writes me word that Charles was very\r\nmuch admired at Kintbury, and Mrs. Lefroy never\r\nsaw any one so much improved in her life, and\r\nthinks him handsomer than Henry. He appears\r\nto far more advantage here than he did at Godmersham,\r\nnot surrounded by strangers and neither\r\noppressed by a pain in his face or powder in his\r\nhair.\nJames christened Elizabeth Caroline on Saturday\r\nmorning, and then came home. Mary, Anna,\r\nand Edward have left us of course; before the\r\nsecond went I took down her answer to her cousin\r\nFanny.\nYesterday came a letter to my mother from\r\nEdward Cooper to announce, not the birth of a\r\nchild, but of a living; for Mrs. Leigh has begged\r\nhis acceptance of the Rectory of Hamstall-Ridware\r\nin Staffordshire, vacant by Mr. Johnson\'s death.\r\nWe collect from his letter that he means to reside\r\nthere, in which he shows his wisdom. Staffordshire\r\nis a good way off; so we shall see nothing\r\nmore of them till, some fifteen years hence, the\r\nMiss Coopers are presented to us, fine, jolly,\r\nhandsome, ignorant girls. The living is valued at\r\n140l. a year, but perhaps it may be improvable.\r\nHow will they be able to convey the furniture of\r\nthe dressing-room so far in safety?\nOur first cousins seem all dropping off very fast.\r\nOne is incorporated into the family, another dies,\r\nand a third goes into Staffordshire. We can learn\r\nnothing of the disposal of the other living. I\r\nhave not the smallest notion of Fulwar\'s having it.\r\nLord Craven has probably other connections and\r\nmore intimate ones, in that line, than he now has\r\nwith the Kintbury family.\nOur ball on Thursday was a very poor one, only\r\neight couple and but twenty-three people in the\r\nroom; but it was not the ball\'s fault, for we were\r\ndeprived of two or three families by the sudden\r\nillness of Mr. Wither, who was seized that morning\r\nat Winchester with a return of his former\r\nalarming complaint. An express was sent off\r\nfrom thence to the family; Catherine and Miss\r\nBlackford were dining with Mrs. Russell. Poor\r\nCatherine\'s distress must have been very great.\r\nShe was prevailed on to wait till the Heathcotes\r\ncould come from Wintney, and then with those\r\ntwo and Harris proceeded directly to Winchester.\r\nIn such a disorder his danger, I suppose, must\r\nalways be great; but from this attack he is now\r\nrapidly recovering, and will be well enough to return\r\nto Manydown, I fancy, in a few days.\nIt was a fine thing for conversation at the ball.\r\nBut it deprived us not only of the Biggs, but of\r\nMrs. Russell too, and of the Boltons and John\r\nHarwood, who were dining there likewise, and of\r\nMr. Lane, who kept away as related to the family.\r\nPoor man!\xe2\x80\x94I mean Mr. Wither\xe2\x80\x94his life is so\r\nuseful, his character so respectable and worthy, that\r\nI really believe there was a good deal of sincerity\r\nin the general concern expressed on his account.\nOur ball was chiefly made up of Jervoises and\r\nTerrys, the former of whom were apt to be vulgar,\r\nthe latter to be noisy. I had an odd set of partners:\r\nMr. Jenkins, Mr. Street, Colonel Jervoise,\r\nJames Digweed, J. Lyford, and Mr. Briggs, a\r\nfriend of the latter. I had a very pleasant evening,\r\nhowever, though you will probably find out\r\nthat there was no particular reason for it; but I\r\ndo not think it worth while to wait for enjoyment\r\nuntil there is some real opportunity for it. Mary\r\nbehaved very well, and was not at all fidgetty.\r\nFor the history of her adventures at the ball I\r\nrefer you to Anna\'s letter.\nWhen you come home you will have some shirts\r\nto make up for Charles. Mrs. Davies frightened\r\nhim into buying a piece of Irish when we were in\r\nBasingstoke. Mr. Daysh supposes that Captain Austen\'s\r\ncommission has reached him by this time.\nTuesday.\xe2\x80\x94Your letter has pleased and amused\r\nme very much. Your essay on happy fortnights\r\nis highly ingenious, and the talobert skin made\r\nme laugh a good deal. Whenever I fall into misfortune,\r\nhow many jokes it ought to furnish to my\r\nacquaintance in general, or I shall die dreadfully\r\nin their debt for entertainment.\nIt began to occur to me before you mentioned it\r\nthat I had been somewhat silent as to my mother\'s\r\nhealth for some time, but I thought you could\r\nhave no difficulty in divining its exact state,\xe2\x80\x94you,\r\nwho have guessed so much stranger things. She\r\nis tolerably well,\xe2\x80\x94better upon the whole than she\r\nwas some weeks ago. She would tell you herself\r\nthat she has a very dreadful cold in her head at\r\npresent; but I have not much compassion for colds\r\nin the head without fever or sore throat.\nOur own particular little brother got a place in\r\nthe coach last night, and is now, I suppose, in\r\ntown. I have no objection at all to your buying\r\nour gowns there, as your imagination has pictured\r\nto you exactly such a one as is necessary to make\r\nme happy. You quite abash me by your progress\r\nin notting, for I am still without silk. You must\r\nget me some in town or in Canterbury; it should\r\nbe finer than yours.\nI thought Edward would not approve of Charles\r\nbeing a crop, and rather wished you to conceal it\r\nfrom him at present, lest it might fall on his\r\nspirits and retard his recovery. My father furnishes\r\nhim with a pig from Cheesedown; it is already\r\nkilled and cut up, but it is not to weigh\r\nmore than nine stone; the season is too far advanced\r\nto get him a larger one. My mother\r\nmeans to pay herself for the salt and the trouble of\r\nordering it to be cured by the spareribs, the souse,\r\nand the lard. We have had one dead lamb.\n\nI congratulate you on Mr. E. Hatton\'s good\r\nfortune. I suppose the marriage will now follow\r\nout of hand. Give my compliments to Miss Finch.\nWhat time in March may we expect your return\r\nin? I begin to be very tired of answering people\'s\r\nquestions on that subject, and independent of that,\r\nI shall be very glad to see you at home again, and\r\nthen if we can get Martha and shirk ... who\r\nwill be so happy as we?\nI think of going to Ibthorp in about a fortnight.\r\nMy eyes are pretty well, I thank you, if you\r\nplease.\nWednesday, 23d.\xe2\x80\x94I wish my dear Fanny\r\nmany returns of this day, and that she may on\r\nevery return enjoy as much pleasure as she is now\r\nreceiving from her doll\'s-beds.\nI have just heard from Charles, who is by this\r\ntime at Deal. He is to be second lieutenant,\r\nwhich pleases him very well. The "Endymion"\r\nis come into the Downs, which pleases him likewise.\r\nHe expects to be ordered to Sheerness\r\nshortly, as the "Tamar" has never been refitted.\nMy father and mother made the same match for\r\nyou last night, and are very much pleased with it.\r\nHe is a beauty of my mother\'s.\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Our journey yesterday\r\nwent off exceedingly well; nothing occurred to\r\nalarm or delay us. We found the roads in excellent\r\norder, had very good horses all the way, and\r\nreached Devizes with ease by four o\'clock. I suppose\r\nJohn has told you in what manner we were\r\ndivided when we left Andover, and no alteration\r\nwas afterwards made. At Devizes we had comfortable\r\nrooms and a good dinner, to which we sat\r\ndown about five; amongst other things we had\r\nasparagus and a lobster, which made me wish for\r\nyou, and some cheesecakes, on which the children\r\nmade so delightful a supper as to endear the town\r\nof Devizes to them for a long time.\nWell, here we are at Bath; we got here about\r\none o\'clock, and have been arrived just long enough\r\nto go over the house, fix on our rooms, and be very\r\nwell pleased with the whole of it. Poor Elizabeth\r\nhas had a dismal ride of it from Devizes, for it\r\nhas rained almost all the way, and our first view\r\nof Bath has been just as gloomy as it was last\r\nNovember twelvemonth.\nI have got so many things to say, so many\r\nthings equally important, that I know not on\r\nwhich to decide at present, and shall therefore go\r\nand eat with the children.\n\nWe stopped in Paragon as we came along, but\r\nas it was too wet and dirty for us to get out, we\r\ncould only see Frank, who told us that his master\r\nwas very indifferent, but had had a better night\r\nlast night than usual. In Paragon we met Mrs.\r\nFoley and Mrs. Dowdeswell with her yellow shawl\r\nairing out, and at the bottom of Kingsdown Hill\r\nwe met a gentleman in a buggy, who, on minute\r\nexamination, turned out to be Dr. Hall\xe2\x80\x94and Dr.\r\nHall in such very deep mourning that either his\r\nmother, his wife, or himself must be dead. These\r\nare all of our acquaintance who have yet met our\r\neyes.\nI have some hopes of being plagued about my\r\ntrunk; I had more a few hours ago, for it was too\r\nheavy to go by the coach which brought Thomas\r\nand Rebecca from Devizes; there was reason to\r\nsuppose that it might be too heavy likewise for\r\nany other coach, and for a long time we could hear\r\nof no wagon to convey it. At last, however, we\r\nunluckily discovered that one was just on the point\r\nof setting out for this place, but at any rate the\r\ntrunk cannot be here till to-morrow; so far we are\r\nsafe, and who knows what may not happen to\r\nprocure a further delay?\nI put Mary\'s letter into the post-office at Andover\r\nwith my own hand.\nWe are exceedingly pleased with the house; the\r\nrooms are quite as large as we expected. Mrs. Bromley\r\nis a fat woman in mourning, and a little black\r\nkitten runs about the staircase. Elizabeth has the\r\napartment within the drawing-room; she wanted\r\nmy mother to have it, but as there was no bed in\r\nthe inner one, and the stairs are so much easier of\r\nascent, or my mother so much stronger than in\r\nParagon as not to regard the double flight, it is\r\nsettled for us to be above, where we have two very\r\nnice-sized rooms, with dirty quilts and everything\r\ncomfortable. I have the outward and larger apartment,\r\nas I ought to have; which is quite as large\r\nas our bedroom at home, and my mother\'s is not\r\nmaterially less. The beds are both as large as any\r\nat Steventon, and I have a very nice chest of\r\ndrawers and a closet full of shelves,\xe2\x80\x94so full indeed\r\nthat there is nothing else in it, and it should\r\ntherefore be called a cupboard rather than a closet,\r\nI suppose.\nTell Mary that there were some carpenters at\r\nwork in the inn at Devizes this morning, but\r\nas I could not be sure of their being Mrs. W.\r\nFowle\'s relations, I did not make myself known\r\nto them.\nI hope it will be a tolerable afternoon. When\r\nfirst we came, all the umbrellas were up, but now\r\nthe pavements are getting very white again.\nMy mother does not seem at all the worse for\r\nher journey, nor are any of us, I hope, though\r\nEdward seemed rather fagged last night, and\r\nnot very brisk this morning; but I trust the\r\nbustle of sending for tea, coffee, and sugar, etc.,\r\nand going out to taste a cheese himself, will do\r\nhim good.\nThere was a very long list of arrivals here in the\r\nnewspaper yesterday, so that we need not immediately\r\ndread absolute solitude; and there is a public\r\nbreakfast in Sydney Gardens every morning, so\r\nthat we shall not be wholly starved.\nElizabeth has just had a very good account of\r\nthe three little boys. I hope you are very busy\r\nand very comfortable. I find no difficulty in closing\r\nmy eyes. I like our situation very much; it\r\nis far more cheerful than Paragon, and the prospect\r\nfrom the drawing-room window, at which I now\r\nwrite, is rather picturesque, as it commands a prospective\r\nview of the left side of Brock Street,\r\nbroken by three Lombardy poplars in the garden\r\nof the last house in Queen\'s Parade.\nI am rather impatient to know the fate of my\r\nbest gown, but I suppose it will be some days\r\nbefore Frances can get through the trunk. In\r\nthe mean time I am, with many thanks for your\r\ntrouble in making it, as well as marking my silk\r\nstockings,\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I am obliged to you\r\nfor two letters, one from yourself and the other\r\nfrom Mary, for of the latter I knew nothing till\r\non the receipt of yours yesterday, when the pigeon-basket\r\nwas examined, and I received my due. As\r\nI have written to her since the time which ought\r\nto have brought me hers, I suppose she will consider\r\nherself, as I choose to consider her, still in\r\nmy debt.\nI will lay out all the little judgment I have in\r\nendeavoring to get such stockings for Anna as she\r\nwill approve; but I do not know that I shall\r\nexecute Martha\'s commission at all, for I am not\r\nfond of ordering shoes; and, at any rate, they shall\r\nall have flat heels.\nWhat must I tell you of Edward? Truth or\r\nfalsehood? I will try the former, and you may\r\nchoose for yourself another time. He was better\r\nyesterday than he had been for two or three days\r\nbefore,\xe2\x80\x94about as well as while he was at Steventon.\r\nHe drinks at the Hetling Pump, is to bathe to-morrow,\r\nand try electricity on Tuesday. He\r\nproposed the latter himself to Dr. Fellowes, who\r\nmade no objection to it, but I fancy we are all\r\nunanimous in expecting no advantage from it. At\r\npresent I have no great notion of our staying here\r\nbeyond the month.\nI heard from Charles last week; they were to\r\nsail on Wednesday.\nMy mother seems remarkably well. My uncle\r\noverwalked himself at first, and can now only\r\ntravel in a chair, but is otherwise very well.\nMy cloak is come home. I like it very much,\r\nand can now exclaim with delight, like J. Bond at\r\nhay-harvest, "This is what I have been looking for\r\nthese three years." I saw some gauzes in a shop\r\nin Bath Street yesterday at only 4d. a yard, but\r\nthey were not so good or so pretty as mine.\r\nFlowers are very much worn, and fruit is still\r\nmore the thing. Elizabeth has a bunch of strawberries,\r\nand I have seen grapes, cherries, plums,\r\nand apricots. There are likewise almonds and\r\nraisins, French plums, and tamarinds at the\r\ngrocers\', but I have never seen any of them in\r\nhats. A plum or greengage would cost three\r\nshillings; cherries and grapes about five, I believe,\r\nbut this is at some of the dearest shops. My aunt\r\nhas told me of a very cheap one, near Walcot\r\nChurch, to which I shall go in quest of something\r\nfor you. I have never seen an old woman at the\r\npump-room.\nElizabeth has given me a hat, and it is not only\r\na pretty hat, but a pretty style of hat too. It is\r\nsomething like Eliza\'s, only, instead of being all\r\nstraw, half of it is narrow purple ribbon. I flatter\r\nmyself, however, that you can understand very little\r\nof it from this description. Heaven forbid that I\r\nshould ever offer such encouragement to explanations\r\nas to give a clear one on any occasion myself!\r\nBut I must write no more of this....\nI spent Friday evening with the Mapletons, and\r\nwas obliged to submit to being pleased in spite of\r\nmy inclination. We took a very charming walk\r\nfrom six to eight up Beacon Hill, and across some\r\nfields, to the village of Charlecombe, which is\r\nsweetly situated in a little green valley, as a village\r\nwith such a name ought to be. Marianne is\r\nsensible and intelligent; and even Jane, considering\r\nhow fair she is, is not unpleasant. We had a\r\nMiss North and a Mr. Gould of our party; the\r\nlatter walked home with me after tea. He is a\r\nvery young man, just entered Oxford, wears\r\nspectacles, and has heard that "Evelina" was\r\nwritten by Dr. Johnson.\nI am afraid I cannot undertake to carry Martha\'s\r\nshoes home, for, though we had plenty of room in\r\nour trunks when we came, we shall have many\r\nmore things to take back, and I must allow besides\r\nfor my packing.\nThere is to be a grand gala on Tuesday evening\r\nin Sydney Gardens, a concert, with illuminations\r\nand fireworks. To the latter Elizabeth and I\r\nlook forward with pleasure, and even the concert\r\nwill have more than its usual charm for me, as the\r\ngardens are large enough for me to get pretty well\r\nbeyond the reach of its sound. In the morning\r\nLady Willoughby is to present the colors to some\r\ncorps, or Yeomanry, or other, in the Crescent, and\r\nthat such festivities may have a proper commencement,\r\nwe think of going to....\nI am quite pleased with Martha and Mrs. Lefroy\r\nfor wanting the pattern of our caps, but I am not\r\nso well pleased with your giving it to them. Some\r\nwish, some prevailing wish, is necessary to the\r\nanimation of everybody\'s mind, and in gratifying\r\nthis you leave them to form some other which will\r\nnot probably be half so innocent. I shall not forget\r\nto write to Frank. Duty and love, etc.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Your letter yesterday\r\nmade me very happy. I am heartily glad that\r\nyou have escaped any share in the impurities of\r\nDeane, and not sorry, as it turns out, that our stay\r\nhere has been lengthened. I feel tolerably secure\r\nof our getting away next week, though it is certainly\r\npossible that we may remain till Thursday\r\nthe 27th. I wonder what we shall do with all our\r\nintended visits this summer! I should like to\r\nmake a compromise with Adlestrop, Harden, and\r\nBookham, that Martha\'s spending the summer at\r\nSteventon should be considered as our respective\r\nvisits to them all.\nEdward has been pretty well for this last week,\r\nand as the waters have never disagreed with him\r\nin any respect, we are inclined to hope that he will\r\nderive advantage from them in the end. Everybody\r\nencourages us in this expectation, for they\r\nall say that the effect of the waters cannot be negative,\r\nand many are the instances in which their\r\nbenefit is felt afterwards more than on the spot.\r\nHe is more comfortable here than I thought he\r\nwould be, and so is Elizabeth, though they will\r\nboth, I believe, be very glad to get away\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlatter especially, which one can\'t wonder at somehow.\r\nSo much for Mrs. Piozzi. I had some\r\nthoughts of writing the whole of my letter in her\r\nstyle, but I believe I shall not.\nThough you have given me unlimited powers\r\nconcerning your sprig, I cannot determine what to\r\ndo about it, and shall therefore in this and in every\r\nother future letter continue to ask your further\r\ndirections. We have been to the cheap shop, and\r\nvery cheap we found it, but there are only flowers\r\nmade there, no fruit; and as I could get four or\r\nfive very pretty sprigs of the former for the same\r\nmoney which would procure only one Orleans\r\nplum\xe2\x80\x94in short, could get more for three or four\r\nshillings than I could have means of bringing\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94I cannot decide on the fruit till I hear from\r\nyou again. Besides, I cannot help thinking that\r\nit is more natural to have flowers grow out of the\r\nhead than fruit. What do you think on that\r\nsubject?\nI would not let Martha read "First Impressions"\r\nagain upon any account, and am very\r\nglad that I did not leave it in your power. She\r\nis very cunning, but I saw through her design;\r\nshe means to publish it from memory, and one\r\nmore perusal must enable her to do it. As for\r\n"Fitzalbini," when I get home she shall have\r\nit, as soon as ever she will own that Mr. Elliott\r\nis handsomer than Mr. Lance, that fair men are\r\npreferable to black; for I mean to take every\r\nopportunity of rooting out her prejudices.\nBenjamin Portal is here. How charming that\r\nis! I do not exactly know why, but the phrase\r\nfollowed so naturally that I could not help putting\r\nit down. My mother saw him the other day,\r\nbut without making herself known to him.\n\nI am very glad you liked my lace, and so are\r\nyou, and so is Martha, and we are all glad together.\r\nI have got your cloak home, which is\r\nquite delightful,\xe2\x80\x94as delightful at least as half\r\nthe circumstances which are called so.\nI do not know what is the matter with me to-day,\r\nbut I cannot write quietly; I am always\r\nwandering away into some exclamation or other.\r\nFortunately I have nothing very particular to\r\nsay.\nWe walked to Weston one evening last week,\r\nand liked it very much. Liked what very much?\r\nWeston? No, walking to Weston. I have not\r\nexpressed myself properly, but I hope you will\r\nunderstand me.\nWe have not been to any public place lately,\r\nnor performed anything out of the common daily\r\nroutine of No. 13 Queen Square, Bath. But to-day\r\nwe were to have dashed away at a very extraordinary\r\nrate, by dining out, had it not so happened\r\nthat we did not go.\nEdward renewed his acquaintance lately with\r\nMr. Evelyn, who lives in the Queen\'s Parade, and\r\nwas invited to a family dinner, which I believe at\r\nfirst Elizabeth was rather sorry at his accepting;\r\nbut yesterday Mrs. Evelyn called on us, and her\r\nmanners were so pleasing that we liked the idea\r\nof going very much. The Biggs would call her a\r\nnice woman. But Mr. Evelyn, who was indisposed\r\nyesterday, is worse to-day, and we are put\r\noff.\nIt is rather impertinent to suggest any household\r\ncare to a housekeeper, but I just venture to\r\nsay that the coffee-mill will be wanted every day\r\nwhile Edward is at Steventon, as he always drinks\r\ncoffee for breakfast.\nFanny desires her love to you, her love to\r\ngrandpapa, her love to Anna, and her love to\r\nHannah; the latter is particularly to be remembered.\r\nEdward desires his love to you, to grandpapa,\r\nto Anna, to little Edward, to Aunt James\r\nand Uncle James, and he hopes all your turkeys\r\nand ducks and chicken and guinea fowls are very\r\nwell; and he wishes you very much to send him\r\na printed letter, and so does Fanny\xe2\x80\x94and they\r\nboth rather think they shall answer it....\nDr. Gardiner was married yesterday to Mrs.\r\nPercy and her three daughters.\nNow I will give you the history of Mary\'s veil,\r\nin the purchase of which I have so considerably\r\ninvolved you that it is my duty to economize for\r\nyou in the flowers. I had no difficulty in getting\r\na muslin veil for half a guinea, and not much\r\nmore in discovering afterwards that the muslin\r\nwas thick, dirty, and ragged, and therefore would\r\nby no means do for a united gift. I changed it\r\nconsequently as soon as I could, and, considering\r\nwhat a state my imprudence had reduced me to,\r\nI thought myself lucky in getting a black lace\r\none for sixteen shillings. I hope the half of that\r\nsum will not greatly exceed what you had intended\r\nto offer upon the altar of sister-in-law\r\naffection.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Your letter took me\r\nquite by surprise this morning; you are very welcome,\r\nhowever, and I am very much obliged to\r\nyou. I believe I drank too much wine last night\r\nat Hurstbourne; I know not how else to account\r\nfor the shaking of my hand to-day. You will\r\nkindly make allowance therefore for any indistinctness\r\nof writing, by attributing it to this\r\nvenial error.\nNaughty Charles did not come on Tuesday, but\r\ngood Charles came yesterday morning. About two\r\no\'clock he walked in on a Gosport hack. His\r\nfeeling equal to such a fatigue is a good sign, and\r\nhis feeling no fatigue in it a still better. He\r\nwalked down to Deane to dinner; he danced the\r\nwhole evening, and to-day is no more tired than a\r\ngentleman ought to be.\nYour desiring to hear from me on Sunday will,\r\nperhaps, bring you a more particular account of\r\nthe ball than you may care for, because one is\r\nprone to think much more of such things the morning\r\nafter they happen, than when time has entirely\r\ndriven them out of one\'s recollection.\nIt was a pleasant evening; Charles found it\r\nremarkably so, but I cannot tell why, unless the\r\nabsence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience\r\nreproaches him with being now perfectly\r\nindifferent, was a relief to him. There were only\r\ntwelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was\r\nmerely prevented from dancing the rest by the\r\nwant of a partner. We began at ten, supped at\r\none, and were at Deane before five. There were\r\nbut fifty people in the room; very few families\r\nindeed from our side of the county, and not many\r\nmore from the other. My partners were the two\r\nSt. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and a very prodigious\r\nMr. Mathew, with whom I called the last, and\r\nwhom I liked the best of my little stock.\nThere were very few beauties, and such as there\r\nwere were not very handsome. Miss Iremonger\r\ndid not look well, and Mrs. Blount was the only\r\none much admired. She appeared exactly as she\r\ndid in September, with the same broad face, diamond\r\nbandeau, white shoes, pink husband, and fat\r\nneck. The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced\r\nin one the remains of the vulgar, broad-featured\r\ngirl who danced at Enham eight years ago; the\r\nother is refined into a nice, composed-looking\r\ngirl, like Catherine Bigg. I looked at Sir Thomas\r\nChampneys, and thought of poor Rosalie; I looked\r\nat his daughter, and thought her a queer animal\r\nwith a white neck. Mrs. Warren I was constrained\r\nto think a very fine young woman, which\r\nI much regret. She danced away with great activity.\r\nHer husband is ugly enough, uglier even\r\nthan his cousin John; but he does not look so very\r\nold. The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish, very\r\nlike Anne, with brown skins, large dark eyes, and a\r\ngood deal of nose. The General has got the gout,\r\nand Mrs. Maitland the jaundice. Miss Debary,\r\nSusan, and Sally, all in black, but without any\r\nstatues, made their appearance, and I was as civil\r\nto them as circumstances would allow me....\nMary said that I looked very well last night.\r\nI wore my aunt\'s gown and handkerchief, and my\r\nhair was at least tidy, which was all my ambition.\r\nI will now have done with the ball, and I will\r\nmoreover go and dress for dinner....\nFarewell; Charles sends you his best love, and\r\nEdward his worst. If you think the distinction\r\nimproper, you may take the worst yourself. He\r\nwill write to you when he gets back to his ship,\r\nand in the mean time desires that you will consider\r\nme as\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94As you have by this\r\ntime received my last letter, it is fit that I should\r\nbegin another; and I begin with the hope, which is\r\nat present uppermost in my mind, that you often\r\nwore a white gown in the morning at the time of\r\nall the gay parties being with you.\nOur visit at Ash Park, last Wednesday, went off\r\nin a come-c\xc3\xa1 way. We met Mr. Lefroy and Tom\r\nChute, played at cards, and came home again.\r\nJames and Mary dined here on the following day,\r\nand at night Henry set off in the mail for London.\r\nHe was as agreeable as ever during his visit, and\r\nhas not lost anything in Miss Lloyd\'s estimation.\nYesterday we were quite alone\xe2\x80\x94only our four\r\nselves; but to-day the scene is agreeably varied\r\nby Mary\'s driving Martha to Basingstoke, and\r\nMartha\'s afterwards dining at Deane.\nMy mother looks forward with as much certainty\r\nas you can do to our keeping two maids;\r\nmy father is the only one not in the secret. We\r\nplan having a steady cook and a young giddy\r\nhousemaid, with a sedate, middle-aged man, who\r\nis to undertake the double office of husband to the\r\nformer and sweetheart to the latter. No children\r\nof course to be allowed on either side.\nYou feel more for John Bond than John Bond\r\ndeserves. I am sorry to lower his character, but\r\nhe is not ashamed to own himself that he has no\r\ndoubt at all of getting a good place, and that he\r\nhad even an offer many years ago from a Farmer\r\nPaine of taking him into his service whenever he\r\nmight quit my father\'s.\nThere are three parts of Bath which we have\r\nthought of as likely to have houses in them,\xe2\x80\x94Westgate\r\nBuildings, Charles Street, and some of\r\nthe short streets leading from Laura Place or\r\nPulteney Street.\nWestgate Buildings, though quite in the lower\r\npart of the town, are not badly situated themselves.\r\nThe street is broad, and has rather a good\r\nappearance. Charles Street, however, I think is\r\npreferable. The buildings are new, and its nearness\r\nto Kingsmead Fields would be a pleasant\r\ncircumstance. Perhaps you may remember, or\r\nperhaps you may forget, that Charles Street leads\r\nfrom the Queen Square Chapel to the two Green\r\nPark Streets.\nThe houses in the streets near Laura Place I\r\nshould expect to be above our price. Gay Street\r\nwould be too high, except only the lower house on\r\nthe left-hand side as you ascend. Towards that\r\nmy mother has no disinclination; it used to be\r\nlower rented than any other house in the row, from\r\nsome inferiority in the apartments. But above all\r\nothers her wishes are at present fixed on the corner\r\nhouse in Chapel Row, which opens into Prince\'s\r\nStreet. Her knowledge of it, however, is confined\r\nonly to the outside, and therefore she is equally\r\nuncertain of its being really desirable as of its\r\nbeing to be had. In the mean time she assures\r\nyou that she will do everything in her power to\r\navoid Trim Street, although you have not expressed\r\nthe fearful presentiment of it which was\r\nrather expected.\nWe know that Mrs. Perrot will want to get us\r\ninto Oxford Buildings, but we all unite in particular\r\ndislike of that part of the town, and therefore\r\nhope to escape. Upon all these different\r\nsituations you and Edward may confer together,\r\nand your opinion of each will be expected with\r\neagerness.\nAs to our pictures, the battle-piece, Mr. Nibbs,\r\nSir William East, and all the old heterogeneous,\r\nmiscellany, manuscript, Scriptural pieces dispersed\r\nover the house, are to be given to James. Your\r\nown drawings will not cease to be your own, and\r\nthe two paintings on tin will be at your disposal.\r\nMy mother says that the French agricultural prints\r\nin the best bedroom were given by Edward to his\r\ntwo sisters. Do you or he know anything about\r\nit?\nShe has written to my aunt, and we are all impatient\r\nfor the answer. I do not know how to give\r\nup the idea of our both going to Paragon in May.\r\nYour going I consider as indispensably necessary,\r\nand I shall not like being left behind; there is no\r\nplace here or hereabouts that I shall want to be\r\nstaying at, and though, to be sure, the keep of two\r\nwill be more than of one, I will endeavor to make\r\nthe difference less by disordering my stomach with\r\nBath buns; and as to the trouble of accommodating\r\nus, whether there are one or two, it is much the\r\nsame.\nAccording to the first plan, my mother and our\r\ntwo selves are to travel down together, and my\r\nfather follow us afterwards in about a fortnight or\r\nthree weeks. We have promised to spend a couple\r\nof days at Ibthorp in our way. We must all meet\r\nat Bath, you know, before we set out for the sea,\r\nand, everything considered, I think the first plan\r\nas good as any.\nMy father and mother, wisely aware of the difficulty\r\nof finding in all Bath such a bed as their\r\nown, have resolved on taking it with them; all the\r\nbeds, indeed, that we shall want are to be removed,\xe2\x80\x94namely,\r\nbesides theirs, our own two, the best\r\nfor a spare one, and two for servants; and these\r\nnecessary articles will probably be the only material\r\nones that it would answer to send down. I\r\ndo not think it will be worth while to remove any\r\nof our chests of drawers; we shall be able to get\r\nsome of a much more commodious sort, made of\r\ndeal, and painted to look very neat; and I flatter\r\nmyself that for little comforts of all kinds our\r\napartment will be one of the most complete things\r\nof the sort all over Bath, Bristol included.\nWe have thought at times of removing the sideboard,\r\nor a Pembroke table, or some other piece of\r\nfurniture, but, upon the whole, it has ended in\r\nthinking that the trouble and risk of the removal\r\nwould be more than the advantage of having them\r\nat a place where everything may be purchased.\r\nPray send your opinion.\nMartha has as good as promised to come to us\r\nagain in March. Her spirits are better than they\r\nwere....\nMy mother bargains for having no trouble at all\r\nin furnishing our house in Bath, and I have engaged\r\nfor your willingly undertaking to do it all.\r\nI get more and more reconciled to the idea of our\r\nremoval. We have lived long enough in this\r\nneighborhood: the Basingstoke balls are certainly\r\non the decline, there is something interesting in\r\nthe bustle of going away, and the prospect of\r\nspending future summers by the sea or in Wales\r\nis very delightful. For a time we shall now possess\r\nmany of the advantages which I have often\r\nthought of with envy in the wives of sailors or soldiers.\r\nIt must not be generally known, however,\r\nthat I am not sacrificing a great deal in quitting\r\nthe country, or I can expect to inspire no tenderness,\r\nno interest, in those we leave behind....\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94The "perhaps" which\r\nconcluded my last letter being only a "perhaps,"\r\nwill not occasion your being overpowered with\r\nsurprise, I dare say, if you should receive this before\r\nTuesday, which, unless circumstances are very\r\nperverse, will be the case. I received yours with\r\nmuch general philanthropy, and still more peculiar\r\ngood-will, two days ago; and I suppose I need\r\nnot tell you that it was very long, being written\r\non a foolscap sheet, and very entertaining, being\r\nwritten by you.\nMr. Payne has been dead long enough for Henry\r\nto be out of mourning for him before his last visit,\r\nthough we knew nothing of it till about that time.\r\nWhy he died, or of what complaint, or to what\r\nnoblemen he bequeathed his four daughters in\r\nmarriage, we have not heard.\nI am glad that the Wildmans are going to give\r\na ball, and hope you will not fail to benefit both\r\nyourself and me by laying out a few kisses in the\r\npurchase of a frank. I believe you are right in\r\nproposing to delay the cambric muslin, and I submit\r\nwith a kind of voluntary reluctance.\nMr. Peter Debary has declined Deane curacy;\r\nhe wishes to be settled near London. A foolish\r\nreason! as if Deane were not near London in comparison\r\nof Exeter or York. Take the whole world\r\nthrough, and he will find many more places at a\r\ngreater distance from London than Deane than he\r\nwill at a less. What does he think of Glencoe or\r\nLake Katherine?\nI feel rather indignant that any possible objection\r\nshould be raised against so valuable a piece of\r\npreferment, so delightful a situation!\xe2\x80\x94that Deane\r\nshould not be universally allowed to be as near the\r\nmetropolis as any other country villages. As this\r\nis the case, however, as Mr. Peter Debary has\r\nshown himself a Peter in the blackest sense of the\r\nword, we are obliged to look elsewhere for an heir;\r\nand my father has thought it a necessary compliment\r\nto James Digweed to offer the curacy to him,\r\nthough without considering it as either a desirable\r\nor an eligible situation for him. Unless he is in\r\nlove with Miss Lyford, I think he had better not\r\nbe settled exactly in this neighborhood; and unless\r\nhe is very much in love with her indeed, he\r\nis not likely to think a salary of 50l. equal in value\r\nor efficiency to one of 75l.\n\nWere you indeed to be considered as one of the\r\nfixtures of the house!\xe2\x80\x94but you were never actually\r\nerected in it either by Mr. Egerton Brydges\r\nor Mrs. Lloyd....\nYou are very kind in planning presents for me\r\nto make, and my mother has shown me exactly the\r\nsame attention; but as I do not choose to have\r\ngenerosity dictated to me, I shall not resolve on\r\ngiving my cabinet to Anna till the first thought of\r\nit has been my own.\nSidmouth is now talked of as our summer abode.\r\nGet all the information, therefore, about it that\r\nyou can from Mrs. C. Cage.\nMy father\'s old ministers are already deserting\r\nhim to pay their court to his son. The brown\r\nmare, which, as well as the black, was to devolve\r\non James at our removal, has not had patience to\r\nwait for that, and has settled herself even now at\r\nDeane. The death of Hugh Capet, which, like\r\nthat of Mr. Skipsey, though undesired, was not\r\nwholly unexpected, being purposely effected, has\r\nmade the immediate possession of the mare very\r\nconvenient, and everything else I suppose will be\r\nseized by degrees in the same manner. Martha\r\nand I work at the books every day.\nPoor Miss Austen! It appears to me that I\r\nhave rather oppressed you of late by the frequency\r\nof my letters. You had hoped not to hear from\r\nme again before Tuesday, but Sunday showed you\r\nwith what a merciless sister you had to deal. I\r\ncannot recall the past, but you shall not hear from\r\nme quite so often in future.\nYour letter to Mary was duly received before\r\nshe left Deane with Martha yesterday morning,\r\nand it gives us great pleasure to know that the\r\nChilham ball was so agreeable, and that you\r\ndanced four dances with Mr. Kemble. Desirable,\r\nhowever, as the latter circumstance was, I cannot\r\nhelp wondering at its taking place. Why did you\r\ndance four dances with so stupid a man? Why\r\nnot rather dance two of them with some elegant\r\nbrother officer who was struck with your appearance\r\nas soon as you entered the room?\nMartha left you her best love. She will write\r\nto you herself in a short time; but trusting to my\r\nmemory rather than her own, she has nevertheless\r\ndesired me to ask you to purchase for her two\r\nbottles of Steele\'s lavender water when you are in\r\ntown, provided you should go to the shop on your\r\nown account, otherwise you may be sure that she\r\nwould not have you recollect the request.\n\nJames dined with us yesterday, wrote to Edward\r\nin the evening, filled three sides of paper, every\r\nline inclining too much towards the northeast,\r\nand the very first line of all scratched out, and\r\nthis morning he joins his lady in the fields of\r\nElysium and Ibthorp.\nLast Friday was a very busy day with us. We\r\nwere visited by Miss Lyford and Mr. Bayle. The\r\nlatter began his operations in the house, but had\r\nonly time to finish the four sitting-rooms; the rest\r\nis deferred till the spring is more advanced and\r\nthe days longer. He took his paper of appraisement\r\naway with him, and therefore we only know\r\nthe estimate he has made of one or two articles of\r\nfurniture which my father particularly inquired\r\ninto. I understand, however, that he was of\r\nopinion that the whole would amount to more than\r\ntwo hundred pounds, and it is not imagined that\r\nthis will comprehend the brewhouse and many\r\nother, etc., etc.\nMiss Lyford was very pleasant, and gave my\r\nmother such an account of the houses in Westgate\r\nBuildings, where Mrs. Lyford lodged four years\r\nago, as made her think of a situation there with\r\ngreat pleasure, but your opposition will be without\r\ndifficulty decisive, and my father, in particular,\r\nwho was very well inclined towards the Row before,\r\nhas now ceased to think of it entirely. At\r\npresent the environs of Laura Place seem to be\r\nhis choice. His views on the subject are much\r\nadvanced since I came home; he grows quite ambitious,\r\nand actually requires now a comfortable and\r\na creditable-looking house.\nOn Saturday Miss Lyford went to her long\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, it was a long way off,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsoon afterwards a party of fine ladies issuing from\r\na well-known commodious green vehicle, their\r\nheads full of Bantam cocks and Galinies, entered\r\nthe house,\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Heathcote, Mrs. Harwood, Mrs.\r\nJames Austen, Miss Bigg, Miss Jane Blachford.\nHardly a day passes in which we do not have\r\nsome visitor or other: yesterday came Mrs. Bramstone,\r\nwho is very sorry that she is to lose us, and\r\nafterwards Mr. Holder, who was shut up for an\r\nhour with my father and James in a most awful\r\nmanner. John Bond est \xc3\xa0 lui....\nExpect a most agreeable letter, for not being\r\noverburdened with subject (having nothing at all\r\nto say), I shall have no check to my genius from\r\nbeginning to end.\nWell, and so Prank\'s letter has made you very\r\nhappy, but you are afraid he would not have\r\npatience to stay for the "Haarlem," which you\r\nwish him to have done as being safer than the\r\nmerchantman. Poor fellow! to wait from the\r\nmiddle of November to the end of December, and\r\nperhaps even longer, it must be sad work; especially\r\nin a place where the ink is so abominably\r\npale. What a surprise to him it must have been\r\non October 20, to be visited, collared, and thrust\r\nout of the "Petterel" by Captain Inglis. He\r\nkindly passes over the poignancy of his feelings\r\nin quitting his ship, his officers, and his men.\nWhat a pity it is that he should not be in\r\nEngland at the time of this promotion, because\r\nhe certainly would have had an appointment, so\r\neverybody says, and therefore it must be right for\r\nme to say it too. Had he been really here, the\r\ncertainty of the appointment, I dare say, would\r\nnot have been half so great, but as it could not be\r\nbrought to the proof, his absence will be always a\r\nlucky source of regret.\nEliza talks of having read in a newspaper that\r\nall the first lieutenants of the frigates whose captains\r\nwere to be sent into line-of-battle ships were\r\nto be promoted to the rank of commanders. If it\r\nbe true, Mr. Valentine may afford himself a fine\r\nValentine\'s knot, and Charles may perhaps become\r\nfirst of the "Endymion," though I suppose Captain\r\nDurham is too likely to bring a villain with\r\nhim under that denomination....\nThe neighborhood have quite recovered the death\r\nof Mrs. Rider,\xe2\x80\x94so much so, that I think they are\r\nrather rejoiced at it now; her things were so very\r\ndear! and Mrs. Rogers is to be all that is desirable.\r\nNot even death itself can fix the friendship\r\nof the world....\nThe Wylmots being robbed must be an amusing\r\nthing to their acquaintance, and I hope it is as\r\nmuch their pleasure as it seems their avocation to\r\nbe subjects of general entertainment.\nI have a great mind not to acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your letter, which I have just had the\r\npleasure of reading, because I am so ashamed to\r\ncompare the sprawling lines of this with it. But\r\nif I say all that I have to say, I hope I have no\r\nreason to hang myself....\nWhy did not J. D. make his proposals to you?\r\nI suppose he went to see the cathedral, that he\r\nmight know how he should like to be married\r\nin it....\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94You were mistaken\r\nin supposing I should expect your letter on Sunday;\r\nI had no idea of hearing from you before\r\nTuesday, and my pleasure yesterday was therefore\r\nunhurt by any previous disappointment. I thank\r\nyou for writing so much; you must really have\r\nsent me the value of two letters in one. We are\r\nextremely glad to hear that Elizabeth is so much\r\nbetter, and hope you will be sensible of still\r\nfurther amendment in her when you return from\r\nCanterbury.\nOf your visit there I must now speak "incessantly;"\r\nit surprises, but pleases me more, and I\r\nconsider it as a very just and honorable distinction\r\nof you, and not less to the credit of Mrs.\r\nKnight. I have no doubt of your spending your\r\ntime with her most pleasantly in quiet and rational\r\nconversation, and am so far from thinking her expectations\r\nof you will be deceived, that my only\r\nfear is of your being so agreeable, so much to her\r\ntaste, as to make her wish to keep you with her\r\nforever. If that should be the case, we must remove\r\nto Canterbury, which I should not like so\r\nwell as Southampton.\nWhen you receive this, our guests will be all\r\ngone or going; and I shall be left to the comfortable\r\ndisposal of my time, to ease of mind from\r\nthe torments of rice puddings and apple dumplings,\r\nand probably to regret that I did not take\r\nmore pains to please them all.\nMrs. J. Austen has asked me to return with her\r\nto Steventon; I need not give my answer; and\r\nshe has invited my mother to spend there the time\r\nof Mrs. F. A.\'s confinement, which she seems half\r\ninclined to do.\n\nA few days ago I had a letter from Miss Irvine,\r\nand as I was in her debt, you will guess it to be a\r\nremonstrance, not a very severe one, however; the\r\nfirst page is in her usual retrospective, jealous,\r\ninconsistent style, but the remainder is chatty and\r\nharmless. She supposes my silence may have proceeded\r\nfrom resentment of her not having written\r\nto inquire particularly after my hooping-cough,\r\netc. She is a funny one.\nI have answered her letter, and have endeavored\r\nto give something like the truth with as little\r\nincivility as I could, by placing my silence to the\r\nwant of subject in the very quiet way in which\r\nwe live. Phebe has repented, and stays. I have\r\nalso written to Charles, and I answered Miss\r\nBuller\'s letter by return of post, as I intended to\r\ntell you in my last.\nTwo or three things I recollected when it was\r\ntoo late, that I might have told you; one is that\r\nthe Welbys have lost their eldest son by a putrid\r\nfever at Eton, and another that Tom Chute is going\r\nto settle in Norfolk.\nYou have scarcely ever mentioned Lizzy since\r\nyour being at Godmersham. I hope it is not because\r\nshe is altered for the worse.\nI cannot yet satisfy Fanny as to Mrs. Foote\'s\r\nbaby\'s name, and I must not encourage her to expect\r\na good one, as Captain Foote is a professed\r\nadversary to all but the plainest; he likes only\r\nMary, Elizabeth, Anne, etc. Our best chance is of\r\n"Caroline," which in compliment to a sister seems\r\nthe only exception.\nHe dined with us on Friday, and I fear will not\r\nsoon venture again, for the strength of our dinner\r\nwas a boiled leg of mutton, underdone even for\r\nJames; and Captain Foote has a particular dislike\r\nto underdone mutton; but he was so good-humored\r\nand pleasant that I did not much mind\r\nhis being starved. He gives us all the most cordial\r\ninvitation to his house in the country, saying\r\njust what the Williams ought to say to make us\r\nwelcome. Of them we have seen nothing since\r\nyou left us, and we hear that they are just gone to\r\nBath again, to be out of the way of further alterations\r\nat Brooklands.\nMrs. F. A. has had a very agreeable letter from\r\nMrs. Dickson, who was delighted with the purse,\r\nand desires her not to provide herself with a christening\r\ndress, which is exactly what her young\r\ncorrespondent wanted; and she means to defer\r\nmaking any of the caps as long as she can, in hope\r\nof having Mrs. D.\'s present in time to be serviceable\r\nas a pattern. She desires me to tell you that\r\nthe gowns were cut out before your letter arrived,\r\nbut that they are long enough for Caroline. The\r\nBeds, as I believe they are called, have fallen to\r\nFrank\'s share to continue, and of course are cut\r\nout to admiration.\n\n"Alphonsine" did not do. We were disgusted\r\nin twenty pages, as, independent of a bad\r\ntranslation, it has indelicacies which disgrace a\r\npen hitherto so pure; and we changed it for the\r\n"Female Quixote," which now makes our evening\r\namusement; to me a very high one, as I find the\r\nwork quite equal to what I remembered it. Mrs.\r\nF. A., to whom it is new, enjoys it as one could\r\nwish; the other Mary, I believe, has little pleasure\r\nfrom that or any other book.\nMy mother does not seem at all more disappointed\r\nthan ourselves at the termination of the\r\nfamily treaty; she thinks less of that just now\r\nthan of the comfortable state of her own finances,\r\nwhich she finds on closing her year\'s accounts\r\nbeyond her expectation, as she begins the new\r\nyear with a balance of 30l. in her favor; and when\r\nshe has written her answer to my aunt, which you\r\nknow always hangs a little upon her mind, she\r\nwill be above the world entirely. You will have\r\na great deal of unreserved discourse with Mrs. K.,\r\nI dare say, upon this subject, as well as upon\r\nmany other of our family matters. Abuse everybody\r\nbut me.\nThursday.\xe2\x80\x94We expected James yesterday, but\r\nhe did not come; if he comes at all now, his\r\nvisit will be a very short one, as he must return\r\nto-morrow, that Ajax and the chair may be sent\r\nto Winchester on Saturday. Caroline\'s new pelisse\r\ndepended upon her mother\'s being able or not to\r\ncome so far in the chair; how the guinea that will\r\nbe saved by the same means of return is to be\r\nspent I know not. Mrs. J. A. does not talk much\r\nof poverty now, though she has no hope of my\r\nbrother\'s being able to buy another horse next\r\nsummer.\nTheir scheme against Warwickshire continues,\r\nbut I doubt the family\'s being at Stoneleigh so\r\nearly as James says he must go, which is May.\nMy mother is afraid I have not been explicit\r\nenough on the subject of her wealth; she began\r\n1806 with 68l. she begins 1807 with 99l., and\r\nthis after 32l. purchase of stock. Frank too has\r\nbeen settling his accounts and making calculations,\r\nand each party feels quite equal to our present expenses;\r\nbut much increase of house-rent would\r\nnot do for either. Frank limits himself, I believe,\r\nto four hundred a year.\nYou will be surprised to hear that Jenny is not\r\nyet come back; we have heard nothing of her since\r\nher reaching Itchingswell, and can only suppose\r\nthat she must be detained by illness in somebody\r\nor other, and that she has been each day expecting\r\nto be able to come on the morrow. I am glad I\r\ndid not know beforehand that she was to be absent\r\nduring the whole or almost the whole of our\r\nfriends being with us, for though the inconvenience\r\nhas not been nothing, I should have feared\r\nstill more. Our dinners have certainly suffered\r\nnot a little by having only Molly\'s head and Molly\'s\r\nhands to conduct them; she fries better than she\r\ndid, but not like Jenny.\nWe did not take our walk on Friday, it was too\r\ndirty, nor have we yet done it; we may perhaps\r\ndo something like it to-day, as after seeing Frank\r\nskate, which he hopes to do in the meadows by the\r\nbeech, we are to treat ourselves with a passage\r\nover the ferry. It is one of the pleasantest frosts\r\nI ever knew, so very quiet. I hope it will last\r\nsome time longer for Frank\'s sake, who is quite\r\nanxious to get some skating; he tried yesterday,\r\nbut it would not do.\nOur acquaintance increase too fast. He was\r\nrecognized lately by Admiral Bertie, and a few\r\ndays since arrived the Admiral and his daughter\r\nCatherine to wait upon us. There was nothing to\r\nlike or dislike in either. To the Berties are to be\r\nadded the Lances, with whose cards we have been\r\nendowed, and whose visit Frank and I returned\r\nyesterday. They live about a mile and three-quarters\r\nfrom S. to the right of the new road to\r\nPortsmouth, and I believe their house is one of\r\nthose which are to be seen almost anywhere among\r\nthe woods on the other side of the Itchen. It is\r\na handsome building, stands high, and in a very\r\nbeautiful situation.\nWe found only Mrs. Lance at home, and whether\r\nshe boasts any offspring besides a grand pianoforte\r\ndid not appear. She was civil and chatty\r\nenough, and offered to introduce us to some acquaintance\r\nin Southampton, which we gratefully\r\ndeclined.\nI suppose they must be acting by the orders of\r\nMr. Lance of Netherton in this civility, as there\r\nseems no other reason for their coming near us.\r\nThey will not come often, I dare say. They live in\r\na handsome style and are rich, and she seemed to\r\nlike to be rich, and we gave her to understand that\r\nwe were far from being so; she will soon feel therefore\r\nthat we are not worth her acquaintance.\nYou must have heard from Martha by this\r\ntime. We have had no accounts of Kintbury since\r\nher letter to me.\nMrs. F. A. has had one fainting fit lately; it\r\ncame on as usual after eating a hearty dinner, but\r\ndid not last long.\nI can recollect nothing more to say. When my\r\nletter is gone, I suppose I shall.\n... Our garden is putting in order by a man\r\nwho bears a remarkably good character, has a very\r\nfine complexion, and asks something less than the\r\nfirst. The shrubs which border the gravel walk, he\r\nsays, are only sweetbrier and roses, and the latter of\r\nan indifferent sort; we mean to get a few of a better\r\nkind, therefore, and at my own particular desire he\r\nprocures us some syringas. I could not do without\r\na syringa, for the sake of Cowper\'s line. We talk\r\nalso of a laburnum. The border under the terrace\r\nwall is clearing away to receive currants and gooseberry\r\nbushes, and a spot is found very proper for\r\nraspberries.\nThe alterations and improvements within doors,\r\ntoo, advance very properly, and the offices will be\r\nmade very convenient indeed. Our dressing-table\r\nis constructing on the spot, out of a large kitchen\r\ntable belonging to the house, for doing which we\r\nhave the permission of Mr. Husket, Lord Lansdown\'s\r\npainter,\xe2\x80\x94domestic painter, I should call\r\nhim, for he lives in the castle. Domestic chaplains\r\nhave given way to this more necessary office, and\r\nI suppose whenever the walls want no touching up\r\nhe is employed about my lady\'s face.\nThe morning was so wet that I was afraid we\r\nshould not be able to see our little visitor; but\r\nFrank, who alone could go to church, called for her\r\nafter service, and she is now talking away at my\r\nside and examining the treasures of my writing-desk\r\ndrawers,\xe2\x80\x94very happy, I believe. Not at all shy,\r\nof course. Her name is Catherine, and her sister\'s\r\nCaroline. She is something like her brother, and\r\nas short for her age, but not so well-looking.\nWhat is become of all the shyness in the world?\r\nMoral as well as natural diseases disappear in the\r\nprogress of time, and new ones take their place.\r\nShyness and the sweating sickness have given way\r\nto confidence and paralytic complaints....\nEvening.\xe2\x80\x94Our little visitor has just left us, and\r\nleft us highly pleased with her; she is a nice, natural,\r\nopen-hearted, affectionate girl, with all the\r\nready civility which one sees in the best children\r\nin the present day; so unlike anything that I was\r\nmyself at her age, that I am often all astonishment\r\nand shame. Half her time was spent at spillikins,\r\nwhich I consider as a very valuable part of our\r\nhousehold furniture, and as not the least important\r\nbenefaction from the family of Knight to that of\r\nAusten.\nBut I must tell you a story. Mary has for some\r\ntime had notice from Mrs. Dickson of the intended\r\narrival of a certain Miss Fowler in this place.\r\nMiss F. is an intimate friend of Mrs. D., and a\r\ngood deal known as such to Mary. On Thursday\r\nlast she called here while we were out. Mary\r\nfound, on our return, her card with only her name\r\non it, and she had left word that she would call\r\nagain. The particularity of this made us talk,\r\nand, among other conjectures, Frank said in joke,\r\n"I dare say she is staying with the Pearsons."\r\nThe connection of the names struck Mary, and she\r\nimmediately recollected Miss Fowler\'s having been\r\nvery intimate with persons so called, and, upon\r\nputting everything together, we have scarcely a\r\ndoubt of her being actually staying with the only\r\nfamily in the place whom we cannot visit.\nWhat a contretemps! in the language of France.\r\nWhat an unluckiness! in that of Madame Duval.\r\nThe black gentleman has certainly employed one\r\nof his menial imps to bring about this complete,\r\nthough trifling mischief. Miss F. has never\r\ncalled again, but we are in daily expectation of it.\r\nMiss P. has, of course, given her a proper understanding\r\nof the business. It is evident that Miss\r\nF. did not expect or wish to have the visit returned,\r\nand Frank is quite as much on his guard\r\nfor his wife as we could desire for her sake or\r\nour own.\nWe shall rejoice in being so near Winchester\r\nwhen Edward belongs to it, and can never have\r\nour spare bed filled more to our satisfaction than\r\nby him. Does he leave Eltham at Easter?\nWe are reading "Clarentine," and are surprised\r\nto find how foolish it is. I remember liking it\r\nmuch less on a second reading than at the first,\r\nand it does not bear a third at all. It is full of\r\nunnatural conduct and forced difficulties, without\r\nstriking merit of any kind.\nMiss Harrison is going into Devonshire, to attend\r\nMrs. Dusantoy, as usual. Miss J. is married\r\nto young Mr. G., and is to be very unhappy. He\r\nswears, drinks, is cross, jealous, selfish, and brutal.\r\nThe match makes her family miserable, and has\r\noccasioned his being disinherited.\nThe Browns are added to our list of acquaintance.\r\nHe commands the Sea Fencibles here, under\r\nSir Thomas, and was introduced at his own desire\r\nby the latter when we saw him last week. As yet\r\nthe gentlemen only have visited, as Mrs. B. is ill;\r\nbut she is a nice-looking woman, and wears one of\r\nthe prettiest straw bonnets in the place.\nMonday.\xe2\x80\x94The garret beds are made, and ours\r\nwill be finished to-day. I had hoped it would be\r\nfinished on Saturday, but neither Mrs. Hall nor\r\nJenny was able to give help enough for that, and\r\nI have as yet done very little, and Mary nothing\r\nat all. This week we shall do more, and I should\r\nlike to have all the five beds completed by the end\r\nof it. There will then be the window-curtains,\r\nsofa-cover, and a carpet to be altered.\nI should not be surprised if we were to be visited\r\nby James again this week; he gave us reason\r\nto expect him soon, and if they go to Eversley he\r\ncannot come next week.\nThere, I flatter myself I have constructed you a\r\nsmartish letter, considering my want of materials;\r\nbut, like my dear Dr. Johnson, I believe I have\r\ndealt more in notions than facts.\nI hope your cough is gone, and that you are\r\notherwise well, and remain, with love,\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Where shall I begin?\r\nWhich of all my important nothings shall I tell\r\nyou first? At half after seven yesterday morning\r\nHenry saw us into our own carriage, and we drove\r\naway from the Bath Hotel; which, by the by, had\r\nbeen found most uncomfortable quarters,\xe2\x80\x94very\r\ndirty, very noisy, and very ill-provided. James\r\nbegan his journey by the coach at five. Our first\r\neight miles were hot; Deptford Hill brought to\r\nmy mind our hot journey into Kent fourteen years\r\nago; but after Blackheath we suffered nothing,\r\nand as the day advanced it grew quite cool. At\r\nDartford, which we reached within the two hours\r\nand three-quarters, we went to the Bull, the same\r\ninn at which we breakfasted in that said journey,\r\nand on the present occasion had about the same\r\nbad butter.\nAt half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling\r\non without any adventure reached Sittingbourne\r\nby three. Daniel was watching for us at\r\nthe door of the George, and I was acknowledged\r\nvery kindly by Mr. and Mrs. Marshall, to the\r\nlatter of whom I devoted my conversation, while\r\nMary went out to buy some gloves. A few minutes,\r\nof course, did for Sittingbourne; and so off\r\nwe drove, drove, drove, and by six o\'clock were at\r\nGodmersham.\nOur two brothers were walking before the house\r\nas we approached, as natural as life. Fanny and\r\nLizzy met us in the Hall with a great deal of\r\npleasant joy; we went for a few minutes into the\r\nbreakfast-parlor, and then proceeded to our rooms.\r\nMary has the Hall chamber. I am in the Yellow\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94very literally\xe2\x80\x94for I am writing in it at\r\nthis moment. It seems odd to me to have such a\r\ngreat place all to myself, and to be at Godmersham\r\nwithout you is also odd.\nYou are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who\r\ncame to me as soon as she had seen her Aunt\r\nJames to her room, and stayed while I dressed,\r\nwas as energetic as usual in her longings for you.\r\nShe is grown both in height and size since last\r\nyear, but not immoderately, looks very well, and\r\nseems as to conduct and manner just what she was\r\nand what one could wish her to continue.\nElizabeth, who was dressing when we arrived,\r\ncame to me for a minute attended by Marianne,\r\nCharles, and Louisa, and, you will not doubt, gave\r\nme a very affectionate welcome. That I had received\r\nsuch from Edward also I need not mention;\r\nbut I do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I never\r\nsaw him look in better health, and Fanny says he\r\nis perfectly well. I cannot praise Elizabeth\'s\r\nlooks, but they are probably affected by a cold.\r\nHer little namesake has gained in beauty in the\r\nlast three years, though not all that Marianne has\r\nlost. Charles is not quite so lovely as he was.\r\nLouisa is much as I expected, and Cassandra I find\r\nhandsomer than I expected, though at present disguised\r\nby such a violent breaking-out that she\r\ndoes not come down after dinner. She has charming\r\neyes and a nice open countenance, and seems\r\nlikely to be very lovable. Her size is magnificent.\nI was agreeably surprised to find Louisa Bridges\r\nstill here. She looks remarkably well (legacies\r\nare very wholesome diet), and is just what she\r\nalways was. John is at Sandling. You may\r\nfancy our dinner-party therefore; Fanny, of course,\r\nbelonging to it, and little Edward, for that day.\r\nHe was almost too happy, his happiness at least\r\nmade him too talkative.\n\nIt has struck ten; I must go to breakfast.\nSince breakfast I have had a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate with\r\nEdward in his room; he wanted to know James\'s\r\nplans and mine, and from what his own now are I\r\nthink it already nearly certain that I shall return\r\nwhen they do, though not with them. Edward\r\nwill be going about the same time to Alton, where\r\nhe has business with Mr. Trimmer, and where he\r\nmeans his son should join him; and I shall probably\r\nbe his companion to that place, and get on\r\nafterwards somehow or other.\nI should have preferred a rather longer stay here\r\ncertainly, but there is no prospect of any later conveyance\r\nfor me, as he does not mean to accompany\r\nEdward on his return to Winchester, from a very\r\nnatural unwillingness to leave Elizabeth at that\r\ntime. I shall at any rate be glad not to be obliged\r\nto be an incumbrance on those who have brought\r\nme here, for, as James has no horse, I must feel in\r\ntheir carriage that I am taking his place. We\r\nwere rather crowded yesterday, though it does not\r\nbecome me to say so, as I and my boa were of the\r\nparty, and it is not to be supposed but that a child\r\nof three years of age was fidgety.\nI need scarcely beg you to keep all this to yourself,\r\nlest it should get round by Anna\'s means.\r\nShe is very kindly inquired after by her friends\r\nhere, who all regret her not coming with her\r\nfather and mother.\n\nI left Henry, I hope, free from his tiresome\r\ncomplaint, in other respects well, and thinking\r\nwith great pleasure of Cheltenham and Stoneleigh.\nThe brewery scheme is quite at an end: at a\r\nmeeting of the subscribers last week it was by\r\ngeneral, and I believe very hearty, consent dissolved.\nThe country is very beautiful. I saw as much\r\nas ever to admire in my yesterday\'s journey....\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I have received\r\nyour letter, and with most melancholy anxiety\r\nwas it expected, for the sad news reached us\r\nlast night, but without any particulars. It came\r\nin a short letter to Martha from her sister, begun\r\nat Steventon and finished in Winchester.\nWe have felt, we do feel, for you all, as you\r\nwill not need to be told,\xe2\x80\x94for you, for Fanny,\r\nfor Henry, for Lady Bridges, and for dearest\r\nEdward, whose loss and whose sufferings seem\r\nto make those of every other person nothing. God\r\nbe praised that you can say what you do of him:\r\nthat he has a religious mind to bear him up, and\r\na disposition that will gradually lead him to\r\ncomfort.\n\nMy dear, dear Fanny, I am so thankful that she\r\nhas you with her! You will be everything to her;\r\nyou will give her all the consolation that human\r\naid can give. May the Almighty sustain you all,\r\nand keep you, my dearest Cassandra, well; but for\r\nthe present I dare say you are equal to everything.\nYou will know that the poor boys are at\r\nSteventon. Perhaps it is best for them, as they\r\nwill have more means of exercise and amusement\r\nthere than they could have with us, but I own\r\nmyself disappointed by the arrangement. I\r\nshould have loved to have them with me at such\r\na time. I shall write to Edward by this post.\nWe shall, of course, hear from you again very\r\nsoon, and as often as you can write. We will\r\nwrite as you desire, and I shall add Bookham.\r\nHamstall, I suppose, you write to yourselves,\r\nas you do not mention it.\nWhat a comfort that Mrs. Deedes is saved from\r\npresent misery and alarm! But it will fall heavy\r\nupon poor Harriot; and as for Lady B., but that\r\nher fortitude does seem truly great, I should fear\r\nthe effect of such a blow, and so unlooked for. I\r\nlong to hear more of you all. Of Henry\'s anguish\r\nI think with grief and solicitude; but he will exert\r\nhimself to be of use and comfort.\nWith what true sympathy our feelings are\r\nshared by Martha you need not be told; she is\r\nthe friend and sister under every circumstance.\n\nWe need not enter into a panegyric on the\r\ndeparted, but it is sweet to think of her great\r\nworth, of her solid principles, of her true devotion,\r\nher excellence in every relation of life. It\r\nis also consolatory to reflect on the shortness of\r\nthe sufferings which led her from this world to\r\na better.\nFarewell for the present, my dearest sister.\r\nTell Edward that we feel for him and pray for\r\nhim.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Your accounts make\r\nus as comfortable as we can expect to be at such\r\na time. Edward\'s loss is terrible, and must be\r\nfelt as such, and these are too early days indeed\r\nto think of moderation in grief, either in him or\r\nhis afflicted daughter, but soon we may hope that\r\nour dear Fanny\'s sense of duty to that beloved\r\nfather will rouse her to exertion. For his sake,\r\nand as the most acceptable proof of love to the\r\nspirit of her departed mother, she will try to be\r\ntranquil and resigned. Does she feel you to be\r\na comfort to her, or is she too much overpowered\r\nfor anything but solitude?\nYour account of Lizzy is very interesting.\r\nPoor child! One must hope the impression will\r\nbe strong, and yet one\'s heart aches for a dejected\r\nmind of eight years old.\nI suppose you see the corpse? How does it\r\nappear? We are anxious to be assured that\r\nEdward will not attend the funeral, but when\r\nit comes to the point I think he must feel it\r\nimpossible.\nYour parcel shall set off on Monday, and I hope\r\nthe shoes will fit; Martha and I both tried them\r\non. I shall send you such of your mourning as\r\nI think most likely to be useful, reserving for\r\nmyself your stockings and half the velvet, in\r\nwhich selfish arrangement I know I am doing\r\nwhat you wish.\nI am to be in bombazeen and crape, according\r\nto what we are told is universal here, and which\r\nagrees with Martha\'s previous observation. My\r\nmourning, however, will not impoverish me, for by\r\nhaving my velvet pelisse fresh lined and made up, I\r\nam sure I shall have no occasion this winter for\r\nanything new of that sort. I take my cloak for\r\nthe lining, and shall send yours on the chance\r\nof its doing something of the same for you,\r\nthough I believe your pelisse is in better repair\r\nthan mine. One Miss Baker makes my gown\r\nand the other my bonnet, which is to be silk\r\ncovered with crape.\nI have written to Edward Cooper, and hope he\r\nwill not send one of his letters of cruel comfort to\r\nmy poor brother: and yesterday I wrote to Alethea\r\nBigg, in reply to a letter from her. She tells us\r\nin confidence that Catherine is to be married on\r\nTuesday se\'nnight. Mr. Hill is expected at Manydown\r\nin the course of the ensuing week.\nWe are desired by Mrs. Harrison and Miss\r\nAusten to say everything proper for them to yourself\r\nand Edward on this sad occasion, especially\r\nthat nothing but a wish of not giving additional\r\ntrouble where so much is inevitable prevents their\r\nwriting themselves to express their concern.\r\nThey seem truly to feel concern.\nI am glad you can say what you do of Mrs.\r\nKnight and of Goodnestone in general. It is\r\na great relief to me to know that the shock did\r\nnot make any of them ill. But what a task was\r\nyours to announce it! Now I hope you are not\r\noverpowered with letter-writing, as Henry and John\r\ncan ease you of many of your correspondents.\nWas Mr. Scudamore in the house at the time,\r\nwas any application attempted, and is the seizure\r\nat all accounted for?\n\nSunday.\xe2\x80\x94As Edward\'s letter to his son is not\r\ncome here, we know that you must have been\r\ninformed as early as Friday of the boys being at\r\nSteventon, which I am glad of.\nUpon your letter to Dr. Goddard\'s being forwarded\r\nto them, Mary wrote to ask whether my\r\nmother wished to have her grandsons sent to her.\r\nWe decided on their remaining where they were,\r\nwhich I hope my brother will approve of. I am\r\nsure he will do us the justice of believing that in\r\nsuch a decision we sacrificed inclination to what\r\nwe thought best.\nI shall write by the coach to-morrow to Mrs.\r\nJ. A., and to Edward, about their mourning,\r\nthough this day\'s post will probably bring directions\r\nto them on that subject from yourselves.\r\nI shall certainly make use of the opportunity of\r\naddressing our nephew on the most serious of all\r\nconcerns, as I naturally did in my letter to him\r\nbefore. The poor boys are, perhaps, more comfortable\r\nat Steventon than they could be here, but\r\nyou will understand my feelings with respect to it.\nTo-morrow will be a dreadful day for you all.\r\nMr. Whitfield\'s will be a severe duty. Glad shall\r\nI be to hear that it is over.\nThat you are forever in our thoughts you will\r\nnot doubt. I see your mournful party in my\r\nmind\'s eye under every varying circumstance of\r\nthe day; and in the evening especially figure to\r\nmyself its sad gloom: the efforts to talk, the frequent\r\nsummons to melancholy orders and cares,\r\nand poor Edward, restless in misery, going from\r\none room to another, and perhaps not seldom upstairs,\r\nto see all that remains of his Elizabeth.\r\nDearest Fanny must now look upon herself as his\r\nprime source of comfort, his dearest friend; as the\r\nbeing who is gradually to supply to him, to the\r\nextent that is possible, what he has lost. This consideration\r\nwill elevate and cheer her.\nAdieu. You cannot write too often, as I said\r\nbefore. We are heartily rejoiced that the poor\r\nbaby gives you no particular anxiety. Kiss dear\r\nLizzy for us. Tell Fanny that I shall write in a\r\nday or two to Miss Sharpe.\nMy mother is not ill.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Edward and George\r\ncame to us soon after seven on Saturday, very well,\r\nbut very cold, having by choice travelled on the\r\noutside, and with no greatcoat but what Mr. Wise,\r\nthe coachman, good-naturedly spared them of his,\r\nas they sat by his side. They were so much\r\nchilled when they arrived, that I was afraid they\r\nmust have taken cold; but it does not seem at all\r\nthe case: I never saw them looking better.\nThey behave extremely well in every respect,\r\nshowing quite as much feeling as one wishes to\r\nsee, and on every occasion speaking of their father\r\nwith the liveliest affection. His letter was read\r\nover by each of them yesterday, and with many\r\ntears; George sobbed aloud, Edward\'s tears do not\r\nflow so easily; but as far as I can judge they are\r\nboth very properly impressed by what has happened.\r\nMiss Lloyd, who is a more impartial judge\r\nthan I can be, is exceedingly pleased with them.\nGeorge is almost a new acquaintance to me,\r\nand I find him in a different way as engaging as\r\nEdward.\nWe do not want amusement: bilbocatch, at\r\nwhich George is indefatigable, spillikins, paper\r\nships, riddles, conundrums, and cards, with watching\r\nthe flow and ebb of the river, and now and\r\nthen a stroll out, keep us well employed; and\r\nwe mean to avail ourselves of our kind papa\'s\r\nconsideration, by not returning to Winchester till\r\nquite the evening of Wednesday.\nMrs. J. A. had not time to get them more than\r\none suit of clothes; their others are making here,\r\nand though I do not believe Southampton is famous\r\nfor tailoring, I hope it will prove itself better\r\nthan Basingstoke. Edward has an old black coat,\r\nwhich will save his having a second new one; but\r\nI find that black pantaloons are considered by\r\nthem as necessary, and of course one would not\r\nhave them made uncomfortable by the want of\r\nwhat is usual on such occasions.\nFanny\'s letter was received with great pleasure\r\nyesterday, and her brother sends his thanks and\r\nwill answer it soon. We all saw what she wrote,\r\nand were very much pleased with it.\nTo-morrow I hope to hear from you, and to-morrow\r\nwe must think of poor Catherine. To-day\r\nLady Bridges is the heroine of our thoughts, and\r\nglad shall we be when we can fancy the meeting\r\nover. There will then be nothing so very bad for\r\nEdward to undergo.\nThe "St. Albans," I find, sailed on the very day\r\nof my letters reaching Yarmouth, so that we must\r\nnot expect an answer at present; we scarcely feel,\r\nhowever, to be in suspense, or only enough to keep\r\nour plans to ourselves. We have been obliged to\r\nexplain them to our young visitors, in consequence\r\nof Fanny\'s letter, but we have not yet mentioned\r\nthem to Steventon. We are all quite familiarized\r\nto the idea ourselves; my mother only wants Mrs.\r\nSeward to go out at midsummer.\nWhat sort of a kitchen garden is there? Mrs.\r\nJ. A. expresses her fear of our settling in Kent,\r\nand, till this proposal was made, we began to look\r\nforward to it here; my mother was actually talking\r\nof a house at Wye. It will be best, however,\r\nas it is.\nAnne has just given her mistress warning; she\r\nis going to be married; I wish she would stay her\r\nyear.\nOn the subject of matrimony, I must notice\r\na wedding in the Salisbury paper, which has\r\namused me very much, Dr. Phillot to Lady Frances\r\nSt. Lawrence. She wanted to have a husband,\r\nI suppose, once in her life, and he a Lady Frances.\nI hope your sorrowing party were at church yesterday,\r\nand have no longer that to dread. Martha\r\nwas kept at home by a cold, but I went with my\r\ntwo nephews, and I saw Edward was much affected\r\nby the sermon, which, indeed, I could have supposed\r\npurposely addressed to the afflicted, if the\r\ntext had not naturally come in the course of Dr.\r\nMant\'s observations on the Litany: \'All that are\r\nin danger, necessity, or tribulation,\' was the subject\r\nof it. The weather did not allow us afterwards\r\nto get farther than the quay, where George\r\nwas very happy as long as we could stay, flying\r\nabout from one side to the other, and skipping on\r\nboard a collier immediately.\nIn the evening we had the Psalms and Lessons,\r\nand a sermon at home, to which they were very attentive;\r\nbut you will not expect to hear that they\r\ndid not return to conundrums the moment it was\r\nover. Their aunt has written pleasantly of them,\r\nwhich was more than I hoped.\nWhile I write now, George is most industriously\r\nmaking and naming paper ships, at which he afterwards\r\nshoots with horse-chestnuts, brought from\r\nSteventon on purpose; and Edward equally intent\r\nover the "Lake of Killarney," twisting himself\r\nabout in one of our great chairs.\nTuesday.\xe2\x80\x94Your close-written letter makes me\r\nquite ashamed of my wide lines; you have sent me\r\na great deal of matter, most of it very welcome.\r\nAs to your lengthened stay, it is no more than I\r\nexpected, and what must be, but you cannot suppose\r\nI like it.\nAll that you say of Edward is truly comfortable;\r\nI began to fear that when the bustle of the\r\nfirst week was over, his spirits might for a time be\r\nmore depressed; and perhaps one must still expect\r\nsomething of the kind. If you escape a bilious attack,\r\nI shall wonder almost as much as rejoice. I\r\nam glad you mentioned where Catherine goes to-day;\r\nit is a good plan, but sensible people may\r\ngenerally be trusted to form such.\nThe day began cheerfully, but it is not likely\r\nto continue what it should, for them or for us.\r\nWe had a little water-party yesterday; I and my\r\ntwo nephews went from the Itchen Ferry up to\r\nNortham, where we landed, looked into the 74,\r\nand walked home, and it was so much enjoyed\r\nthat I had intended to take them to Netley\r\nto-day; the tide is just right for our going immediately\r\nafter moonshine, but I am afraid\r\nthere will be rain; if we cannot get so far, however,\r\nwe may perhaps go round from the ferry\r\nto the quay.\nI had not proposed doing more than cross the\r\nItchen yesterday, but it proved so pleasant, and\r\nso much to the satisfaction of all, that when we\r\nreached the middle of the stream we agreed to be\r\nrowed up the river; both the boys rowed great\r\npart of the way, and their questions and remarks,\r\nas well as their enjoyment, were very amusing;\r\nGeorge\'s inquiries were endless, and his eagerness\r\nin everything reminds me often of his uncle\r\nHenry.\nOur evening was equally agreeable in its way:\r\nI introduced speculation, and it was so much approved\r\nthat we hardly knew how to leave off.\nYour idea of an early dinner to-morrow is exactly\r\nwhat we propose, for, after writing the first\r\npart of this letter, it came into my head that at\r\nthis time of year we have not summer evenings.\r\nWe shall watch the light to-day, that we may not\r\ngive them a dark drive to-morrow.\nThey send their best love to papa and everybody,\r\nwith George\'s thanks for the letter brought\r\nby this post. Martha begs my brother may be\r\nassured of her interest in everything relating to\r\nhim and his family, and of her sincerely partaking\r\nour pleasure in the receipt of every good account\r\nfrom Godmersham.\nOf Chawton I think I can have nothing more\r\nto say, but that everything you say about it in the\r\nletter now before me will, I am sure, as soon as I\r\nam able to read it to her, make my mother consider\r\nthe plan with more and more pleasure. We had\r\nformed the same views on H. Digweed\'s farm.\nA very kind and feeling letter is arrived to-day\r\nfrom Kintbury. Mrs. Fowle\'s sympathy and solicitude\r\non such an occasion you will be able to do\r\njustice to, and to express it as she wishes to my\r\nbrother. Concerning you, she says: "Cassandra\r\nwill, I know, excuse my writing to her; it is not\r\nto save myself but her that I omit so doing. Give\r\nmy best, my kindest love to her, and tell her I feel\r\nfor her as I know she would for me on the same\r\noccasion, and that I most sincerely hope her health\r\nwill not suffer."\n\nWe have just had two hampers of apples from\r\nKintbury, and the floor of our little garret is\r\nalmost covered. Love to all.\nYour letter, my dear Cassandra, obliges me to\r\nwrite immediately, that you may have the earliest\r\nnotice of Frank\'s intending, if possible, to go to\r\nGodmersham exactly at the time now fixed for\r\nyour visit to Goodnestone.\nHe resolved, almost directly on the receipt of\r\nyour former letter, to try for an extension of his\r\nleave of absence, that he might be able to go down\r\nto you for two days, but charged me not to give you\r\nany notice of it, on account of the uncertainty of\r\nsuccess. Now, however, I must give it, and now\r\nperhaps he may be giving it himself; for I am just\r\nin the hateful predicament of being obliged to\r\nwrite what I know will somehow or other be of\r\nno use.\nHe meant to ask for five days more, and if\r\nthey were granted, to go down by Thursday night\'s\r\nmail, and spend Friday and Saturday with you;\r\nand he considered his chance of succeeding by no\r\nmeans bad. I hope it will take place as he planned,\r\nand that your arrangements with Goodnestone may\r\nadmit of suitable alteration.\nYour news of Edward Bridges was quite news,\r\nfor I have had no letter from Wrotham. I wish\r\nhim happy with all my heart, and hope his choice\r\nmay turn out according to his own expectations,\r\nand beyond those of his family; and I dare say it\r\nwill. Marriage is a great improver, and in a\r\nsimilar situation Harriet may be as amiable as\r\nEleanor. As to money, that will come, you may\r\nbe sure, because they cannot do without it. When\r\nyou see him again, pray give him our congratulations\r\nand best wishes. This match will certainly\r\nset John and Lucy going.\nThere are six bedchambers at Chawton; Henry\r\nwrote to my mother the other day, and luckily\r\nmentioned the number, which is just what we\r\nwanted to be assured of. He speaks also of garrets\r\nfor store-places, one of which she immediately\r\nplanned fitting up for Edward\'s man-servant;\r\nand now perhaps it must be for our own; for she\r\nis already quite reconciled to our keeping one.\r\nThe difficulty of doing without one had been\r\nthought of before. His name shall be Robert, if\r\nyou please.\nBefore I can tell you of it, you will have heard\r\nthat Miss Sawbridge is married. It took place, I\r\nbelieve, on Thursday. Mrs. Fowle has for some\r\ntime been in the secret, but the neighborhood in\r\ngeneral were quite unsuspicious. Mr. Maxwell\r\nwas tutor to the young Gregorys,\xe2\x80\x94consequently,\r\nthey must be one of the happiest couples in the\r\nworld, and either of them worthy of envy, for she\r\nmust be excessively in love, and he mounts from\r\nnothing to a comfortable home. Martha has heard\r\nhim very highly spoken of. They continue for the\r\npresent at Speen Hill.\nI have a Southampton match to return for your\r\nKentish one, Captain G. Heathcote and Miss A.\r\nLyell. I have it from Alethea, and like it, because\r\nI had made it before.\nYes, the Stoneleigh business is concluded, but\r\nit was not till yesterday that my mother was regularly\r\ninformed of it, though the news had reached\r\nus on Monday evening by way of Steventon. My\r\naunt says as little as may be on the subject by way\r\nof information, and nothing at all by way of satisfaction.\r\nShe reflects on Mr. T. Leigh\'s dilatoriness,\r\nand looks about with great diligence and\r\nsuccess for inconvenience and evil, among which\r\nshe ingeniously places the danger of her new housemaids\r\ncatching cold on the outside of the coach,\r\nwhen she goes down to Bath, for a carriage makes\r\nher sick.\nJohn Binns has been offered their place, but\r\ndeclines it; as she supposes, because he will not\r\nwear a livery. Whatever be the cause, I like the\r\neffect.\n\nIn spite of all my mother\'s long and intimate\r\nknowledge of the writer, she was not up to the expectation\r\nof such a letter as this; the discontentedness\r\nof it shocked and surprised her\xe2\x80\x94but I see\r\nnothing in it out of nature, though a sad nature.\nShe does not forget to wish for Chambers, you\r\nmay be sure. No particulars are given, not a word\r\nof arrears mentioned, though in her letter to James\r\nthey were in a general way spoken of. The amount\r\nof them is a matter of conjecture, and to my\r\nmother a most interesting one; she cannot fix any\r\ntime for their beginning with any satisfaction to\r\nherself but Mrs. Leigh\'s death, and Henry\'s two\r\nthousand pounds neither agrees with that period\r\nnor any other. I did not like to own our previous\r\ninformation of what was intended last July, and\r\nhave therefore only said that if we could see Henry\r\nwe might hear many particulars, as I had understood\r\nthat some confidential conversation had passed\r\nbetween him and Mr. T. L. at Stoneleigh.\nWe have been as quiet as usual since Frank and\r\nMary left us; Mr. Criswick called on Martha that\r\nvery morning on his way home again from Portsmouth,\r\nand we have had no visitor since.\nWe called on the Miss Lyells one day, and\r\nheard a good account of Mr. Heathcote\'s canvass,\r\nthe success of which, of course, exceeds his expectations.\r\nAlethea in her letter hopes for my interest,\r\nwhich I conclude means Edward\'s, and I take\r\nthis opportunity, therefore, of requesting that he\r\nwill bring in Mr. Heathcote. Mr. Lane told us\r\nyesterday that Mr. H. had behaved very handsomely,\r\nand waited on Mr. Thistlethwaite, to say\r\nthat if he (Mr. T.) would stand, he (Mr. H.) would\r\nnot oppose him; but Mr. T. declined it, acknowledging\r\nhimself still smarting under the payment\r\nof late electioneering costs.\nThe Mrs. Hulberts, we learn from Kintbury,\r\ncome to Steventon this week, and bring Mary Jane\r\nFowle with them on her way to Mrs. Nune\'s; she\r\nreturns at Christmas with her brother.\nOur brother we may perhaps see in the course of\r\na few days, and we mean to take the opportunity\r\nof his help to go one night to the play. Martha\r\nought to see the inside of the theatre once while\r\nshe lives in Southampton, and I think she will\r\nhardly wish to take a second view.\nThe furniture of Bellevue is to be sold to-morrow,\r\nand we shall take it in our usual walk, if the\r\nweather be favorable.\nHow could you have a wet day on Thursday?\r\nWith us it was a prince of days, the most delightful\r\nwe have had for weeks; soft, bright, with a brisk\r\nwind from the southwest; everybody was out and\r\ntalking of spring, and Martha and I did not know\r\nhow to turn back. On Friday evening we had\r\nsome very blowing weather,\xe2\x80\x94from six to nine;\r\nI think we never heard it worse, even here. And\r\none night we had so much rain that it forced its\r\nway again into the store-closet; and though the\r\nevil was comparatively slight and the mischief\r\nnothing, I had some employment the next day in\r\ndrying parcels, etc. I have now moved still more\r\nout of the way.\nMartha sends her best love, and thanks you for\r\nadmitting her to the knowledge of the pros and\r\ncons about Harriet Foote; she has an interest in\r\nall such matters. I am also to say that she wants\r\nto see you. Mary Jane missed her papa and\r\nmamma a good deal at first, but now does very\r\nwell without them. I am glad to hear of little\r\nJohn\'s being better, and hope your accounts of\r\nMrs. Knight will also improve. Adieu! remember\r\nme affectionately to everybody, and believe me,\nMany thanks, my dear Cassandra, to you and\r\nMr. Deedes for your joint and agreeable composition,\r\nwhich took me by surprise this morning. He\r\nhas certainly great merit as a writer; he does ample\r\njustice to his subject, and without being diffuse\r\nis clear and correct; and though I do not\r\nmean to compare his epistolary powers with yours,\r\nor to give him the same portion of my gratitude,\r\nhe certainly has a very pleasing way of winding up\r\na whole, and speeding truth into the world.\n"But all this," as my dear Mrs. Piozzi says,\r\n"is flight and fancy and nonsense, for my master\r\nhas his great casks to mind and I have my little\r\nchildren." It is you, however, in this instance,\r\nthat have the little children, and I that have the\r\ngreat cask, for we are brewing spruce beer again;\r\nbut my meaning really is, that I am extremely\r\nfoolish in writing all this unnecessary stuff when\r\nI have so many matters to write about that my\r\npaper will hardly hold it all. Little matters they\r\nare, to be sure, but highly important.\nIn the first place, Miss Curling is actually at\r\nPortsmouth, which I was always in hopes would not\r\nhappen. I wish her no worse, however, than a long\r\nand happy abode there. Here she would probably\r\nbe dull, and I am sure she would be troublesome.\nThe bracelets are in my possession, and everything\r\nI could wish them to be. They came\r\nwith Martha\'s pelisse, which likewise gives great\r\nsatisfaction.\nSoon after I had closed my last letter to you we\r\nwere visited by Mrs. Dickens and her sister-in-law,\r\nMrs. Bertie, the wife of a lately made Admiral.\r\nMrs. F. A., I believe, was their first object, but\r\nthey put up with us very kindly, and Mrs. D.,\r\nfinding in Miss Lloyd a friend of Mrs. Dundas, had\r\nanother motive for the acquaintance. She seems\r\na really agreeable woman,\xe2\x80\x94that is, her manners\r\nare gentle, and she knows a great many of our\r\nconnections in West Kent. Mrs. Bertie lives in\r\nthe Polygon, and was out when we returned her\r\nvisit, which are her two virtues.\nA larger circle of acquaintance, and an increase\r\nof amusement, is quite in character with our approaching\r\nremoval. Yes, I mean to go to as many\r\nballs as possible, that I may have a good bargain.\r\nEverybody is very much concerned at our going\r\naway, and everybody is acquainted with Chawton,\r\nand speaks of it as a remarkably pretty village,\r\nand everybody knows the house we describe, but\r\nnobody fixes on the right.\nI am very much obliged to Mrs. Knight for\r\nsuch a proof of the interest she takes in me, and\r\nshe may depend upon it that I will marry Mr.\r\nPapillon, whatever may be his reluctance or my\r\nown. I owe her much more than such a trifling\r\nsacrifice.\nOur ball was rather more amusing than I expected.\r\nMartha liked it very much, and I did not\r\ngape till the last quarter of an hour. It was past\r\nnine before we were sent for, and not twelve when\r\nwe returned. The room was tolerably full, and\r\nthere were, perhaps, thirty couple of dancers. The\r\nmelancholy part was to see so many dozen young\r\nwomen standing by without partners, and each of\r\nthem with two ugly naked shoulders.\nIt was the same room in which we danced fifteen\r\nyears ago. I thought it all over, and in spite of\r\nthe shame of being so much older, felt with thankfulness\r\nthat I was quite as happy now as then.\r\nWe paid an additional shilling for our tea, which\r\nwe took as we chose in an adjoining and very comfortable\r\nroom.\nThere were only four dances, and it went to my\r\nheart that the Miss Lances (one of them, too,\r\nnamed Emma) should have partners only for two.\r\nYou will not expect to hear that I was asked to\r\ndance, but I was\xe2\x80\x94by the gentleman whom we\r\nmet that Sunday with Captain D\'Auvergne. We\r\nhave always kept up a bowing acquaintance since,\r\nand, being pleased with his black eyes, I spoke to\r\nhim at the ball, which brought on me this civility;\r\nbut I do not know his name, and he seems so little\r\nat home in the English language that I believe\r\nhis black eyes may be the best of him. Captain\r\nD\'Auvergne has got a ship.\nMartha and I made use of the very favorable\r\nstate of yesterday for walking, to pay our duty at\r\nChiswell. We found Mrs. Lance at home and\r\nalone, and sat out three other ladies who soon came\r\nin. We went by the ferry, and returned by the\r\nbridge, and were scarcely at all fatigued.\n\nEdward must have enjoyed the last two days.\r\nYou, I presume, had a cool drive to Canterbury.\r\nKitty Foote came on Wednesday; and her evening\r\nvisit began early enough for the last part, the apple-pie,\r\nof our dinner, for we never dine now till five.\nYesterday I\xe2\x80\x94or rather, you\xe2\x80\x94had a letter from\r\nNanny Hilliard, the object of which is that she\r\nwould be very much obliged to us if we would get\r\nHannah a place. I am sorry that I cannot assist\r\nher; if you can, let me know, as I shall not answer\r\nthe letter immediately. Mr. Sloper is married\r\nagain, not much to Nanny\'s, or anybody\'s satisfaction.\r\nThe lady was governess to Sir Robert\'s\r\nnatural children, and seems to have nothing to\r\nrecommend her. I do not find, however, that\r\nNanny is likely to lose her place in consequence.\r\nShe says not a word of what service she wishes for\r\nHannah, or what Hannah can do; but a nursery, I\r\nsuppose, or something of that kind, must be the\r\nthing.\nHaving now cleared away my smaller articles\r\nof news, I come to a communication of some\r\nweight; no less than that my uncle and aunt are\r\ngoing to allow James 100l. a year. We hear of it\r\nthrough Steventon. Mary sent us the other day\r\nan extract from my aunt\'s letter on the subject, in\r\nwhich the donation is made with the greatest kindness,\r\nand intended as a compensation for his loss\r\nin the conscientious refusal of Hampstead living;\r\n100l. a year being all that he had at the time\r\ncalled its worth, as I find it was always intended\r\nat Steventon to divide the real income with\r\nKintbury.\nNothing can be more affectionate than my aunt\'s\r\nlanguage in making the present, and likewise in\r\nexpressing her hope of their being much more together\r\nin future than, to her great regret, they\r\nhave of late years been. My expectations for my\r\nmother do not rise with this event. We will allow\r\na little more time, however, before we fly out.\nIf not prevented by parish business, James\r\ncomes to us on Monday. The Mrs. Hulberts and\r\nMiss Murden are their guests at present, and\r\nlikely to continue such till Christmas. Anna\r\ncomes home on the 19th. The hundred a year\r\nbegins next Lady-day.\nI am glad you are to have Henry with you\r\nagain; with him and the boys you cannot but have\r\na cheerful, and at times even a merry, Christmas.\r\nMartha is so [MSS. torn].\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. We want to be\r\nsettled at Chawton in time for Henry to come to\r\nus for some shooting in October, at least, or a\r\nlittle earlier, and Edward may visit us after taking\r\nhis boys back to Winchester. Suppose we\r\nname the 4th of September. Will not that do?\nI have but one thing more to tell you. Mrs.\r\nHill called on my mother yesterday while we were\r\ngone to Chiswell, and in the course of the visit\r\nasked her whether she knew anything of a clergyman\'s\r\nfamily of the name of Alford, who had resided\r\nin our part of Hampshire. Mrs. Hill had\r\nbeen applied to as likely to give some information\r\nof them on account of their probable vicinity to\r\nDr. Hill\'s living by a lady, or for a lady, who had\r\nknown Mrs. and the two Miss Alfords in Bath,\r\nwhither they had removed it seems from Hampshire,\r\nand who now wishes to convey to the Miss\r\nAlfords some work or trimming which she has been\r\ndoing for them; but the mother and daughters\r\nhave left Bath, and the lady cannot learn where\r\nthey are gone to. While my mother gave us the\r\naccount, the probability of its being ourselves occurred\r\nto us, and it had previously struck herself\r\n... what makes it more likely, and even indispensably\r\nto be us, is that she mentioned Mr. Hammond\r\nas now having the living or curacy which\r\nthe father had had. I cannot think who our kind\r\nlady can be, but I dare say we shall not like the\r\nwork.\nDistribute the affectionate love of a heart not so\r\ntired as the right hand belonging to it.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I can now write at\r\nleisure and make the most of my subjects, which\r\nis lucky, as they are not numerous this week.\nOur house was cleared by half-past eleven on\r\nSaturday, and we had the satisfaction of hearing\r\nyesterday that the party reached home in safety\r\nsoon after five.\nI was very glad of your letter this morning; for,\r\nmy mother taking medicine, Eliza keeping her bed\r\nwith a cold, and Choles not coming, made us rather\r\ndull and dependent on the post. You tell me much\r\nthat gives me pleasure, but I think not much to\r\nanswer. I wish I could help you in your needlework.\r\nI have two hands and a new thimble that\r\nlead a very easy life.\nLady Sondes\' match surprises, but does not\r\noffend me; had her first marriage been of affection,\r\nor had there been a grown-up single daughter,\r\nI should not have forgiven her; but I consider\r\neverybody as having a right to marry once in their\r\nlives for love, if they can, and provided she will now\r\nleave off having bad headaches and being pathetic,\r\nI can allow her, I can wish her, to be happy.\nDo not imagine that your picture of your t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate\r\nwith Sir B. makes any change in our expectations\r\nhere; he could not be really reading,\r\nthough he held the newspaper in his hand; he was\r\nmaking up his mind to the deed, and the manner\r\nof it. I think you will have a letter from him\r\nsoon.\nI heard from Portsmouth yesterday, and as I\r\nam to send them more clothes, they cannot be\r\nexpecting a very early return to us. Mary\'s face\r\nis pretty well, but she must have suffered a great\r\ndeal with it; an abscess was formed and opened.\nOur evening party on Thursday produced nothing\r\nmore remarkable than Miss Murden\'s coming\r\ntoo, though she had declined it absolutely in the\r\nmorning, and sitting very ungracious and very\r\nsilent with us from seven o\'clock till half after\r\neleven, for so late was it, owing to the chairmen,\r\nbefore we got rid of them.\nThe last hour, spent in yawning and shivering\r\nin a wide circle round the fire, was dull enough,\r\nbut the tray had admirable success. The widgeon\r\nand the preserved ginger were as delicious as one\r\ncould wish. But as to our black butter, do not\r\ndecoy anybody to Southampton by such a lure, for\r\nit is all gone. The first pot was opened when\r\nFrank and Mary were here, and proved not at all\r\nwhat it ought to be; it was neither solid nor entirely\r\nsweet, and on seeing it, Eliza remembered\r\nthat Miss Austen had said she did not think it\r\nhad been boiled enough. It was made, you know,\r\nwhen we were absent. Such being the event of\r\nthe first pot, I would not save the second, and\r\nwe therefore ate it in unpretending privacy; and\r\nthough not what it ought to be, part of it was very\r\ngood.\nJames means to keep three horses on this increase\r\nof income; at present he has but one. Mary\r\nwishes the other two to be fit to carry women, and\r\nin the purchase of one Edward will probably be\r\ncalled upon to fulfil his promise to his godson.\r\nWe have now pretty well ascertained James\'s income\r\nto be eleven hundred pounds, curate paid,\r\nwhich makes us very happy,\xe2\x80\x94the ascertainment\r\nas well as the income.\nMary does not talk of the garden; it may well\r\nbe a disagreeable subject to her, but her husband\r\nis persuaded that nothing is wanting to make the\r\nfirst new one good but trenching, which is to be\r\ndone by his own servants and John Bond, by degrees,\r\nnot at the expense which trenching the\r\nother amounted to.\nI was happy to hear, chiefly for Anna\'s sake,\r\nthat a ball at Manydown was once more in agitation;\r\nit is called a child\'s ball, and given by Mrs.\r\nHeathcote to Wm. Such was its beginning at\r\nleast, but it will probably swell into something\r\nmore. Edward was invited during his stay at\r\nManydown, and it is to take place between this\r\nand Twelfth-day. Mrs. Hulbert has taken Anna\r\na pair of white shoes on the occasion.\n\nI forgot in my last to tell you that we hear, by\r\nway of Kintbury and the Palmers, that they were\r\nall well at Bermuda in the beginning of Nov.\nWednesday.\xe2\x80\x94Yesterday must have been a day\r\nof sad remembrance at Gm. I am glad it is over.\r\nWe spent Friday evening with our friends at the\r\nboarding-house, and our curiosity was gratified by\r\nthe sight of their fellow-inmates, Mrs. Drew and\r\nMiss Hook, Mr. Wynne and Mr. Fitzhugh; the\r\nlatter is brother to Mrs. Lance, and very much\r\nthe gentleman. He has lived in that house more\r\nthan twenty years, and, poor man! is so totally\r\ndeaf that they say he could not hear a cannon, were\r\nit fired close to him; having no cannon at hand to\r\nmake the experiment, I took it for granted, and\r\ntalked to him a little with my fingers, which\r\nwas funny enough. I recommended him to read\r\n"Corinna."\nMiss Hook is a well-behaved, genteelish woman;\r\nMrs. Drew well behaved, without being at all\r\ngenteel. Mr. Wynne seems a chatty and rather\r\nfamiliar young man. Miss Murden was quite a\r\ndifferent creature this last evening from what she\r\nhad been before, owing to her having with\r\nMartha\'s help found a situation in the morning,\r\nwhich bids very fair for comfort. When she leaves\r\nSteventon, she comes to board and lodge with Mrs.\r\nHookey, the chemist\xe2\x80\x94for there is no Mr. Hookey.\r\nI cannot say that I am in any hurry for the conclusion\r\nof her present visit, but I was truly glad\r\nto see her comfortable in mind and spirits; at her\r\nage, perhaps, one may be as friendless oneself, and\r\nin similar circumstances quite as captious.\nMy mother has been lately adding to her possessions\r\nin plate,\xe2\x80\x94a whole tablespoon and a whole\r\ndessert-spoon, and six whole teaspoons,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nmakes our sideboard border on the magnificent.\r\nThey were mostly the produce of old or useless silver.\r\nI have turned the 11s. in the list into 12s.,\r\nand the card looks all the better; a silver tea-ladle\r\nis also added, which will at least answer the purpose\r\nof making us sometimes think of John\r\nWarren.\nI have laid Lady Sondes\' case before Martha,\r\nwho does not make the least objection to it, and is\r\nparticularly pleased with the name of Montresor.\r\nI do not agree with her there, but I like his rank\r\nvery much, and always affix the ideas of strong\r\nsense and highly elegant manners to a general.\nI must write to Charles next week. You may\r\nguess in what extravagant terms of praise Earle\r\nHarwood speaks of him. He is looked up to by\r\neverybody in all America.\nI shall not tell you anything more of Wm. Digweed\'s\r\nchina, as your silence on the subject makes\r\nyou unworthy of it. Mrs. H. Digweed looks forward\r\nwith great satisfaction to our being her\r\nneighbors. I would have her enjoy the idea to the\r\nutmost, as I suspect there will not be much in the\r\nreality. With equal pleasure we anticipate an intimacy\r\nwith her husband\'s bailiff and his wife,\r\nwho live close by us, and are said to be remarkably\r\ngood sort of people.\nYes, yes, we will have a pianoforte, as good a\r\none as can be got for thirty guineas, and I will\r\npractise country dances, that we may have some\r\namusement for our nephews and nieces, when we\r\nhave the pleasure of their company.\nMartha sends her love to Henry, and tells him\r\nthat he will soon have a bill of Miss Chaplin\'s,\r\nabout 14l., to pay on her account; but the bill\r\nshall not be sent in till his return to town. I hope\r\nhe comes to you in good health, and in spirits as\r\ngood as a first return to Godmersham can allow.\r\nWith his nephews he will force himself to be\r\ncheerful, till he really is so. Send me some intelligence\r\nof Eliza; it is a long while since I have\r\nheard of her.\nWe have had snow on the ground here almost a\r\nweek; it is now going, but Southampton must\r\nboast no longer. We all send our love to Edward\r\njunior and his brothers, and I hope Speculation is\r\ngenerally liked.\nFare you well.\nI am not surprised, my dear Cassandra, that you\r\ndid not find my last letter very full of matter, and\r\nI wish this may not have the same deficiency; but\r\nwe are doing nothing ourselves to write about, and\r\nI am therefore quite dependent upon the communications\r\nof our friends, or my own wits.\nThis post brought me two interesting letters,\r\nyours and one from Bookham, in answer to an inquiry\r\nof mine about your good godmother, of whom\r\nwe had lately received a very alarming account\r\nfrom Paragon. Miss Arnold was the informant\r\nthen, and she spoke of Mrs. E. L. having been\r\nvery dangerously ill, and attended by a physician\r\nfrom Oxford.\nYour letter to Adlestrop may perhaps bring you\r\ninformation from the spot, but in case it should\r\nnot, I must tell you that she is better; though Dr.\r\nBourne cannot yet call her out of danger; such was\r\nthe case last Wednesday, and Mrs. Cooke\'s having\r\nhad no later account is a favorable sign. I am to\r\nhear again from the latter next week, but not this,\r\nif everything goes on well.\nHer disorder is an inflammation on the lungs,\r\narising from a severe chill taken in church last\r\nSunday three weeks; her mind all pious composure,\r\nas may be supposed. George Cooke was there\r\nwhen her illness began; his brother has now taken\r\nhis place. Her age and feebleness considered,\r\none\'s fears cannot but preponderate, though her\r\namendment has already surpassed the expectation\r\nof the physician at the beginning. I am sorry to\r\nadd that Becky is laid up with a complaint of the\r\nsame kind.\nI am very glad to have the time of your return\r\nat all fixed; we all rejoice in it, and it will not be\r\nlater than I had expected. I dare not hope that\r\nMary and Miss Curling may be detained at Portsmouth\r\nso long or half so long; but it would be\r\nworth twopence to have it so.\nThe "St. Albans" perhaps may soon be off to\r\nhelp bring home what may remain by this time of\r\nour poor army, whose state seems dreadfully critical.\r\nThe "Regency" seems to have been heard\r\nof only here; my most political correspondents\r\nmake no mention of it. Unlucky that I should\r\nhave wasted so much reflection on the subject.\nI can now answer your question to my mother\r\nmore at large, and likewise more at small\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nequal perspicuity and minuteness; for the very day\r\nof our leaving Southampton is fixed; and if the\r\nknowledge is of no use to Edward, I am sure it\r\nwill give him pleasure. Easter Monday, April 3,\r\nis the day; we are to sleep that night at Alton,\r\nand be with our friends at Bookham the next, if\r\nthey are then at home; there we remain till the\r\nfollowing Monday, and on Tuesday, April 11,\r\nhope to be at Godmersham. If the Cookes are\r\nabsent, we shall finish our journey on the 5th.\r\nThese plans depend of course upon the weather,\r\nbut I hope there will be no settled cold to delay\r\nus materially.\nTo make you amends for being at Bookham, it\r\nis in contemplation to spend a few days at Baiton\r\nLodge in our way out of Kent. The hint of such a\r\nvisit is most affectionately welcomed by Mrs. Birch,\r\nin one of her odd pleasant letters lately, in which\r\nshe speaks of us with the usual distinguished kindness,\r\ndeclaring that she shall not be at all satisfied\r\nunless a very handsome present is made us immediately\r\nfrom one quarter.\nFanny\'s not coming with you is no more than\r\nwe expected; and as we have not the hope of a\r\nbed for her, and shall see her so soon afterwards\r\nat Godmersham, we cannot wish it otherwise.\nWilliam will be quite recovered, I trust, by the\r\ntime you receive this. What a comfort his cross-stitch\r\nmust have been! Pray tell him that I should\r\nlike to see his work very much. I hope our\r\nanswers this morning have given satisfaction; we\r\nhad great pleasure in Uncle Deedes\' packet; and\r\npray let Marianne know, in private, that I think\r\nshe is quite right to work a rug for Uncle John\'s\r\ncoffee urn, and that I am sure it must give great\r\npleasure to herself now, and to him when he\r\nreceives it.\nThe preference of Brag over Speculation does\r\nnot greatly surprise me, I believe, because I feel\r\nthe same myself; but it mortifies me deeply, because\r\nSpeculation was under my patronage; and,\r\nafter all, what is there so delightful in a pair\r\nroyal of Braggers? It is but three nines or three\r\nknaves, or a mixture of them. When one comes to\r\nreason upon it, it cannot stand its ground against\r\nSpeculation,\xe2\x80\x94of which I hope Edward is now\r\nconvinced. Give my love to him if he is.\nThe letter from Paragon before mentioned was\r\nmuch like those which had preceded it, as to the\r\nfelicity of its writer. They found their house so\r\ndirty and so damp that they were obliged to be a\r\nweek at an inn. John Binns had behaved most\r\nunhandsomely, and engaged himself elsewhere.\r\nThey have a man, however, on the same footing,\r\nwhich my aunt does not like, and she finds both\r\nhim and the new maid-servant very, very inferior\r\nto Robert and Martha. Whether they mean to\r\nhave any other domestics does not appear, nor\r\nwhether they are to have a carriage while they are\r\nin Bath.\nThe Holders are as usual, though I believe it\r\nis not very usual for them to be happy, which they\r\nnow are at a great rate, in Hooper\'s marriage.\r\nThe Irvines are not mentioned. The American\r\nlady improved as we went on; but still the same\r\nfaults in part recurred.\nWe are now in Margiana, and like it very well\r\nindeed. We are just going to set off for Northumberland\r\nto be shut up in Widdrington Tower,\r\nwhere there must be two or three sets of victims\r\nalready immured under a very fine villain.\nWednesday.\xe2\x80\x94Your report of Eliza\'s health\r\ngives me great pleasure, and the progress of the\r\nbank is a constant source of satisfaction. With\r\nsuch increasing profits, tell Henry that I hope he\r\nwill not work poor High-Diddle so hard as he used\r\nto do.\nHas your newspaper given a sad story of a\r\nMrs. Middleton, wife of a farmer in Yorkshire, her\r\nsister, and servant, being almost frozen to death in\r\nthe late weather, her little child quite so? I hope\r\nthe sister is not our friend Miss Woodd, and I\r\nrather think her brother-in-law had moved into\r\nLincolnshire, but their name and station accord\r\ntoo well. Mrs. M. and the maid are said to be\r\ntolerably recovered, but the sister is likely to lose\r\nthe use of her limbs.\n\nCharles\'s rug will be finished to-day, and sent\r\nto-morrow to Frank, to be consigned by him to Mr.\r\nTurner\'s care; and I am going to send Marmion\r\nout with it,\xe2\x80\x94very generous in me, I think.\nAs we have no letter from Adlestrop, we may\r\nsuppose the good woman was alive on Monday,\r\nbut I cannot help expecting bad news from thence\r\nor Bookham in a few days. Do you continue quite\r\nwell?\nHave you nothing to say of your little namesake?\r\nWe join in love and many happy returns.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I am happy to say\r\nthat we had no second letter from Bookham last\r\nweek. Yours has brought its usual measure of\r\nsatisfaction and amusement, and I beg your acceptance\r\nof all the thanks due on the occasion. Your\r\noffer of cravats is very kind, and happens to be\r\nparticularly adapted to my wants, but it was an\r\nodd thing to occur to you.\n\nYes, we have got another fall of snow, and are\r\nvery dreadful; everything seems to turn to snow\r\nthis winter.\nI hope you have had no more illness among you,\r\nand that William will be soon as well as ever.\r\nHis working a footstool for Chawton is a most\r\nagreeable surprise to me, and I am sure his grandmamma\r\nwill value it very much as a proof of his\r\naffection and industry, but we shall never have the\r\nheart to put our feet upon it. I believe I must\r\nwork a muslin cover in satin stitch to keep it from\r\nthe dirt. I long to know what his colors are. I\r\nguess greens and purples.\nEdward and Henry have started a difficulty respecting\r\nour journey, which, I must own with\r\nsome confusion, had never been thought of by us;\r\nbut if the former expected by it to prevent our\r\ntravelling into Kent entirely, he will be disappointed,\r\nfor we have already determined to go the\r\nCroydon road on leaving Bookham and sleep at\r\nDartford. Will not that do? There certainly\r\ndoes seem no convenient resting-place on the other\r\nroad.\nAnna went to Clanville last Friday, and I have\r\nhopes of her new aunt\'s being really worth her\r\nknowing. Perhaps you may never have heard that\r\nJames and Mary paid a morning visit there in\r\nform some weeks ago, and Mary, though by no\r\nmeans disposed to like her, was very much pleased\r\nwith her indeed. Her praise, to be sure, proves\r\nnothing more than Mrs. M.\'s being civil and attentive\r\nto them, but her being so is in favor of\r\nher having good sense. Mary writes of Anna as\r\nimproved in person, but gives her no other commendation.\r\nI am afraid her absence now may\r\ndeprive her of one pleasure, for that silly Mr.\r\nHammond is actually to give his ball on Friday.\nWe had some reason to expect a visit from Earle\r\nHarwood and James this week, but they do not\r\ncome. Miss Murden arrived last night at Mrs.\r\nHookey\'s, as a message and a basket announced to\r\nus. You will therefore return to an enlarged and,\r\nof course, improved society here, especially as the\r\nMiss Williamses are come back.\nWe were agreeably surprised the other day by a\r\nvisit from your beauty and mine, each in a new\r\ncloth mantle and bonnet; and I dare say you will\r\nvalue yourself much on the modest propriety of\r\nMiss W.\'s taste, hers being purple and Miss\r\nGrace\'s scarlet.\nI can easily suppose that your six weeks here\r\nwill be fully occupied, were it only in lengthening\r\nthe waists of your gowns. I have pretty well arranged\r\nmy spring and summer plans of that kind,\r\nand mean to wear out my spotted muslin before I\r\ngo. You will exclaim at this, but mine really has\r\nsigns of feebleness, which with a little care may\r\ncome to something.\n\nMartha and Dr. Mant are as bad as ever; he\r\nruns after her in the street to apologize for having\r\nspoken to a gentleman while she was near him the\r\nday before. Poor Mrs. Mant can stand it no\r\nlonger; she is retired to one of her married\r\ndaughters\'.\nWhen William returns to Winchester Mary\r\nJane is to go to Mrs. Nune\'s for a month, and then\r\nto Steventon for a fortnight, and it seems likely\r\nthat she and her aunt Martha may travel into\r\nBerkshire together.\nWe shall not have a month of Martha after your\r\nreturn, and that month will be a very interrupted\r\nand broken one, but we shall enjoy ourselves the\r\nmore when we can get a quiet half-hour together.\nTo set against your new novel, of which nobody\r\never heard before, and perhaps never may again,\r\nwe have got "Ida of Athens," by Miss Owenson,\r\nwhich must be very clever, because it was written,\r\nas the authoress says, in three months. We have\r\nonly read the preface yet, but her Irish girl does\r\nnot make me expect much. If the warmth of her\r\nlanguage could affect the body, it might be worth\r\nreading in this weather.\nAdieu! I must leave off to stir the fire and call\r\non Miss Murden.\nEvening.\xe2\x80\x94I have done them both, the first\r\nvery often. We found our friend as comfortable\r\nas she can ever allow herself to be in cold weather.\r\nThere is a very neat parlor behind the shop for\r\nher to sit in, not very light indeed, being \xc3\xa0 la\r\nSouthampton, the middle of three deep, but very\r\nlively from the frequent sound of the pestle and\r\nmortar.\nWe afterwards called on the Miss Williamses,\r\nwho lodge at Durantoy\'s. Miss Mary only was at\r\nhome, and she is in very indifferent health. Dr.\r\nHacket came in while we were there, and said\r\nthat he never remembered such a severe winter\r\nas this in Southampton before. It is bad, but we\r\ndo not suffer as we did last year, because the wind\r\nhas been more N.E. than N.W.\nFor a day or two last week my mother was very\r\npoorly with a return of one of her old complaints,\r\nbut it did not last long, and seems to have left\r\nnothing bad behind it. She began to talk of a\r\nserious illness, her two last having been preceded\r\nby the same symptoms, but, thank heaven! she is\r\nnow quite as well as one can expect her to be in\r\nweather which deprives her of exercise.\nMiss M. conveys to us a third volume of sermons,\r\nfrom Hamstall, just published, and which\r\nwe are to like better than the two others; they\r\nare professedly practical, and for the use of country\r\ncongregations. I have just received some\r\nverses in an unknown hand, and am desired to\r\nforward them to my nephew Edward at Godmersham.\n\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I will give you the\r\nindulgence of a letter on Thursday this week, instead\r\nof Friday, but I do not require you to write\r\nagain before Sunday, provided I may believe you\r\nand your finger going on quite well. Take care\r\nof your precious self; do not work too hard.\r\nRemember that Aunt Cassandras are quite as\r\nscarce as Miss Beverleys.\nI had the happiness yesterday of a letter from\r\nCharles, but I shall say as little about it as possible,\r\nbecause I know that excruciating Henry will have\r\nhad a letter likewise, to make all my intelligence\r\nvalueless. It was written at Bermuda on the 7th\r\nand 10th of December. All well, and Fanny\r\nstill only in expectation of being otherwise.\r\nHe had taken a small prize in his late cruise,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nFrench schooner, laden with sugar; but\r\nbad weather parted them, and she had not yet\r\nbeen heard of. His cruise ended December\r\n1st. My September letter was the latest he had\r\nreceived.\nThis day three weeks you are to be in London,\r\nand I wish you better weather; not but that you\r\nmay have worse, for we have now nothing but\r\nceaseless snow or rain and insufferable dirt to\r\ncomplain of; no tempestuous winds nor severity\r\nof cold. Since I wrote last we have had something\r\nof each, but it is not genteel to rip up old\r\ngrievances.\nYou used me scandalously by not mentioning\r\nEdward Cooper\'s sermons. I tell you everything,\r\nand it is unknown the mysteries you conceal from\r\nme; and, to add to the rest, you persevere in giving\r\na final "e" to "invalid," thereby putting it\r\nout of one\'s power to suppose Mrs. E. Leigh, even\r\nfor a moment, a veteran soldier. She, good woman,\r\nis, I hope, destined for some further placid enjoyment\r\nof her own excellence in this world, for her\r\nrecovery advances exceedingly well.\nI had this pleasant news in a letter from Bookham\r\nlast Thursday; but as the letter was from\r\nMary instead of her mother, you will guess her\r\naccount was not equally good from home. Mrs.\r\nCooke had been confined to her bed some days by\r\nillness, but was then better, and Mary wrote in\r\nconfidence of her continuing to mend. I have desired\r\nto hear again soon.\nYou rejoice me by what you say of Fanny. I\r\nhope she will not turn good-for-nothing this ever\r\nso long. We thought of and talked of her yesterday\r\nwith sincere affection, and wished her a long\r\nenjoyment of all the happiness to which she seems\r\nborn. While she gives happiness to those about\r\nher she is pretty sure of her own share.\nI am gratified by her having pleasure in what I\r\nwrite, but I wish the knowledge of my being exposed\r\nto her discerning criticism may not hurt my\r\nstyle, by inducing too great a solicitude. I begin\r\nalready to weigh my words and sentences more\r\nthan I did, and am looking about for a sentiment,\r\nan illustration, or a metaphor in every corner of\r\nthe room. Could my ideas flow as fast as the rain\r\nin the store-closet, it would be charming.\nWe have been in two or three dreadful states\r\nwithin the last week, from the melting of the\r\nsnow, etc., and the contest between us and the\r\ncloset has now ended in our defeat. I have been\r\nobliged to move almost everything out of it, and\r\nleave it to splash itself as it likes.\nYou have by no means raised my curiosity after\r\nCaleb. My disinclination for it before was affected,\r\nbut now it is real. I do not like the evangelicals.\r\nOf course I shall be delighted when I\r\nread it, like other people; but till I do I dislike it.\nI am sorry my verses did not bring any return\r\nfrom Edward. I was in hopes they might, but I\r\nsuppose he does not rate them high enough. It\r\nmight be partiality, but they seemed to me purely\r\nclassical,\xe2\x80\x94just like Homer and Virgil, Ovid and\r\nPropria que Maribus.\nI had a nice brotherly letter from Frank the\r\nother day, which, after an interval of nearly three\r\nweeks, was very welcome. No orders were come\r\non Friday, and none were come yesterday, or we\r\nshould have heard to-day. I had supposed Miss C.\r\nwould share her cousin\'s room here, but a message\r\nin this letter proves the contrary. I will make\r\nthe garret as comfortable as I can, but the possibilities\r\nof that apartment are not great.\nMy mother has been talking to Eliza about our\r\nfuture home, and she, making no difficulty at all\r\nof the sweetheart, is perfectly disposed to continue\r\nwith us, but till she has written home for mother\'s\r\napprobation cannot quite decide. Mother does not\r\nlike to have her so far off. At Chawton she will\r\nbe nine or ten miles nearer, which I hope will\r\nhave its due influence.\nAs for Sally, she means to play John Binns\r\nwith us, in her anxiety to belong to our household\r\nagain. Hitherto she appears a very good servant.\nYou depend upon finding all your plants dead,\r\nI hope. They look very ill, I understand.\nYour silence on the subject of our ball makes\r\nme suppose your curiosity too great for words. We\r\nwere very well entertained, and could have stayed\r\nlonger but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey\r\nme home, and I did not like to keep them\r\nwaiting in the cold. The room was tolerably full,\r\nand the ball opened by Miss Glyn. The Miss\r\nLances had partners, Captain Dauvergne\'s friend\r\nappeared in regimentals, Caroline Maitland had an\r\nofficer to flirt with, and Mr. John Harrison was\r\ndeputed by Captain Smith, being himself absent,\r\nto ask me to dance. Everything went well, you\r\nsee, especially after we had tucked Mrs. Lance\'s\r\nneckerchief in behind and fastened it with a pin.\nWe had a very full and agreeable account of Mr.\r\nHammond\'s ball from Anna last night; the same\r\nfluent pen has sent similar information, I know,\r\ninto Kent. She seems to have been as happy as\r\none could wish her, and the complacency of her\r\nmamma in doing the honors of the evening must\r\nhave made her pleasure almost as great. The\r\ngrandeur of the meeting was beyond my hopes.\r\nI should like to have seen Anna\'s looks and performance,\r\nbut that sad cropped head must have\r\ninjured the former.\nMartha pleases herself with believing that if I\r\nhad kept her counsel you would never have heard\r\nof Dr. M.\'s late behavior, as if the very slight\r\nmanner in which I mentioned it could have been\r\nall on which you found your judgment. I do not\r\nendeavor to undeceive her, because I wish her\r\nhappy, at all events, and know how highly she\r\nprizes happiness of any kind. She is, moreover,\r\nso full of kindness for us both, and sends you in\r\nparticular so many good wishes about your finger,\r\nthat I am willing to overlook a venial fault, and\r\nas Dr. M. is a clergyman, their attachment, however\r\nimmoral, has a decorous air. Adieu, sweet\r\nYou. This is grievous news from Spain. It is\r\nwell that Dr. Moore was spared the knowledge of\r\nsuch a son\'s death.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I was not much surprised\r\nyesterday by the agreeable surprise of your\r\nletter, and extremely glad to receive the assurance\r\nof your finger being well again.\nHere is such a wet day as never was seen. I\r\nwish the poor little girls had better weather for\r\ntheir journey; they must amuse themselves with\r\nwatching the raindrops down the windows. Sackree,\r\nI suppose, feels quite broken-hearted. I cannot\r\nhave done with the weather without observing\r\nhow delightfully mild it is; I am sure Fanny\r\nmust enjoy it with us. Yesterday was a very\r\nblowing day; we got to church, however, which\r\nwe had not been able to do for two Sundays\r\nbefore.\nI am not at all ashamed about the name of the\r\nnovel, having been guilty of no insult toward\r\nyour handwriting; the diphthong I always saw,\r\nbut knowing how fond you were of adding a vowel\r\nwherever you could, I attributed it to that alone,\r\nand the knowledge of the truth does the book no\r\nservice; the only merit it could have was in the\r\nname of Caleb, which has an honest, unpretending\r\nsound, but in C[oe]lebs there is pedantry and affectation.\r\nIs it written only to classical scholars?\nI shall now try to say only what is necessary,\r\nI am weary of meandering; so expect a vast deal\r\nof small matter, concisely told, in the next two\r\npages.\nMrs. Cooke has been very dangerously ill, but\r\nis now, I hope, safe. I had a letter last week\r\nfrom George, Mary being too busy to write, and\r\nat that time the disorder was called of the typhus\r\nkind, and their alarm considerable, but yesterday\r\nbrought me a much better account from Mary,\r\nthe origin of the complaint being now ascertained\r\nto be bilious, and the strong medicines requisite\r\npromising to be effectual. Mrs. E. L. is so much\r\nrecovered as to get into the dressing-room every\r\nday.\nA letter from Hamstall gives us the history of\r\nSir Tho. Williams\'s return. The Admiral, whoever\r\nhe might he, took a fancy to the "Neptune,"\r\nand having only a worn-out 74 to offer in lieu of\r\nit, Sir Tho. declined such a command, and is come\r\nhome passenger. Lucky man! to have so fair an\r\nopportunity of escape. I hope his wife allows\r\nherself to be happy on the occasion, and does not\r\ngive all her thoughts to being nervous.\nA great event happens this week at Hamstall\r\nin young Edward\'s removal to school. He is\r\ngoing to Rugby, and is very happy in the idea of\r\nit; I wish his happiness may last, but it will be\r\na great change to become a raw school-boy from\r\nbeing a pompous sermon-writer and a domineering\r\nbrother. It will do him good, I dare say.\nCaroline has had a great escape from being\r\nburnt to death lately. As her husband gives the\r\naccount, we must believe it true. Miss Murden\r\nis gone,\xe2\x80\x94called away by the critical state of Mrs.\r\nPottinger who has had another severe stroke, and\r\nis without sense or speech. Miss Murden wishes\r\nto return to Southampton if circumstances suit,\r\nbut it must be very doubtful.\nWe have been obliged to turn away Cholles, he\r\ngrew so very drunken and negligent, and we have\r\na man in his place called Thomas.\n\nMartha desires me to communicate something\r\nconcerning herself which she knows will give you\r\npleasure, as affording her very particular satisfaction,\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nis that she is to be in town this spring\r\nwith Mrs. Dundas. I need not dilate on the subject.\r\nYou understand enough of the whys and\r\nwherefores to enter into her feelings, and to be\r\nconscious that of all possible arrangements it is\r\nthe one most acceptable to her. She goes to Barton\r\non leaving us, and the family remove to town\r\nin April.\nWhat you tell me of Miss Sharpe is quite new,\r\nand surprises me a little; I feel, however, as you\r\ndo. She is born, poor thing! to struggle with\r\nevil, and her continuing with Miss B. is, I hope,\r\na proof that matters are not always so very bad between\r\nthem as her letters sometimes represent.\nJenny\'s marriage I had heard of, and supposed\r\nyou would do so too from Steventon, as I knew\r\nyou were corresponding with Mary at the time. I\r\nhope she will not sully the respectable name she\r\nnow bears.\nYour plan for Miss Curling is uncommonly considerate\r\nand friendly, and such as she must surely\r\njump at. Edward\'s going round by Steventon,\r\nas I understand he promises to do, can be no\r\nreasonable objection; Mrs. J. Austen\'s hospitality\r\nis just of the kind to enjoy such a visitor.\nWe were very glad to know Aunt Fanny was\r\nin the country when we read of the fire. Pray\r\ngive my best compliments to the Mrs. Finches, if\r\nthey are at Gm. I am sorry to find that Sir J.\r\nMoore has a mother living, but though a very\r\nheroic son he might not be a very necessary one to\r\nher happiness. Deacon Morrell may be more to\r\nMrs. Morrell.\nI wish Sir John had united something of the\r\nChristian with the hero in his death. Thank\r\nheaven! we have had no one to care for particularly\r\namong the troops,\xe2\x80\x94no one, in fact, nearer to\r\nus than Sir John himself. Col. Maitland is safe\r\nand well; his mother and sisters were of course\r\nanxious about him, but there is no entering much\r\ninto the solicitudes of that family.\nMy mother is well, and gets out when she can\r\nwith the same enjoyment, and apparently the same\r\nstrength, as hitherto. She hopes you will not\r\nomit begging Mrs. Seward to get the garden\r\ncropped for us, supposing she leaves the house too\r\nearly to make the garden any object to herself.\r\nWe are very desirous of receiving your account\r\nof the house, for your observations will have a\r\nmotive which can leave nothing to conjecture and\r\nsuffer nothing from want of memory. For one\'s\r\nown dear self, one ascertains and remembers\r\neverything.\nLady Sondes is an impudent woman to come\r\nback into her old neighborhood again; I suppose\r\nshe pretends never to have married before, and\r\nwonders how her father and mother came to have\r\nher christened Lady Sondes.\nThe store-closet, I hope, will never do so again,\r\nfor much of the evil is proved to have proceeded\r\nfrom the gutter being choked up, and we have had\r\nit cleared. We had reason to rejoice in the child\'s\r\nabsence at the time of the thaw, for the nursery\r\nwas not habitable. We hear of similar disasters\r\nfrom almost everybody.\nNo news from Portsmouth. We are very patient.\r\nMrs. Charles Fowle desires to be kindly\r\nremembered to you. She is warmly interested in\r\nmy brother and his family.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I have so many little\r\nmatters to tell you of, that I cannot wait any longer\r\nbefore I begin to put them down. I spent Tuesday\r\nin Bentinck Street. The Cookes called here and\r\ntook me back, and it was quite a Cooke day, for\r\nthe Miss Rolles paid a visit while I was there, and\r\nSam Arnold dropped in to tea.\n\nThe badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent\r\nplan of mine,\xe2\x80\x94that of calling on Miss\r\nBeckford again; but from the middle of the day it\r\nrained incessantly. Mary and I, after disposing\r\nof her father and mother, went to the Liverpool\r\nMuseum and the British Gallery, and I had some\r\namusement at each, though my preference for men\r\nand women always inclines me to attend more to\r\nthe company than the sight.\nMrs. Cooke regrets very much that she did not\r\nsee you when you called; it was owing to a blunder\r\namong the servants, for she did not know of\r\nour visit till we were gone. She seems tolerably\r\nwell, but the nervous part of her complaint, I fear,\r\nincreases, and makes her more and more unwilling\r\nto part with Mary.\nI have proposed to the latter that she should go\r\nto Chawton with me, on the supposition of my\r\ntravelling the Guildford road, and she, I do believe,\r\nwould be glad to do it, but perhaps it may be impossible;\r\nunless a brother can be at home at that\r\ntime, it certainly must. George comes to them\r\nto-day.\nI did not see Theo. till late on Tuesday; he was\r\ngone to Ilford, but he came back in time to show\r\nhis usual nothing-meaning, harmless, heartless\r\ncivility. Henry, who had been confined the whole\r\nday to the bank, took me in his way home, and,\r\nafter putting life and wit into the party for a quarter\r\nof an hour, put himself and his sister into a\r\nhackney coach.\nI bless my stars that I have done with Tuesday.\r\nBut, alas! Wednesday was likewise a day of great\r\ndoings, for Manon and I took our walk to Grafton\r\nHouse, and I have a good deal to say on that\r\nsubject.\nI am sorry to tell you that I am getting very extravagant,\r\nand spending all my money, and, what\r\nis worse for you, I have been spending yours too;\r\nfor in a linendraper\'s shop to which I went for\r\nchecked muslin, and for which I was obliged to\r\ngive seven shillings a yard, I was tempted by a\r\npretty-colored muslin, and bought ten yards of it\r\non the chance of your liking it; but at the same\r\ntime, if it should not suit you, you must not think\r\nyourself at all obliged to take it; it is only 3s. 6d.\r\nper yard, and I should not in the least mind keeping\r\nthe whole. In texture it is just what we prefer,\r\nbut its resemblance to green crewels, I must\r\nown, is not great, for the pattern is a small red\r\nspot. And now I believe I have done all my commissions\r\nexcept Wedgwood.\nI liked my walk very much; it was shorter than\r\nI had expected, and the weather was delightful.\r\nWe set off immediately after breakfast, and must\r\nhave reached Grafton House by half-past eleven;\r\nbut when we entered the shop the whole counter\r\nwas thronged, and we waited full half an hour before\r\nwe could be attended to. When we were\r\nserved, however, I was very well satisfied with my\r\npurchases,\xe2\x80\x94my bugle trimming at 2s. 4d. and\r\nthree pair silk stockings for a little less than 12s.\r\na pair.\nIn my way back who should I meet but Mr.\r\nMoore, just come from Beckenham. I believe he\r\nwould have passed me if I had not made him stop,\r\nbut we were delighted to meet. I soon found,\r\nhowever, that he had nothing new to tell me, and\r\nthen I let him go.\nMiss Burton has made me a very pretty little\r\nbonnet, and now nothing can satisfy me but I\r\nmust have a straw hat, of the riding-hat shape,\r\nlike Mrs. Tilson\'s; and a young woman in this\r\nneighborhood is actually making me one. I am\r\nreally very shocking, but it will not be dear at a\r\nguinea. Our pelisses are 17s. each; she charges\r\nonly 8s. for the making, but the buttons seem expensive,\xe2\x80\x94are\r\nexpensive, I might have said, for\r\nthe fact is plain enough.\nWe drank tea again yesterday with the Tilsons,\r\nand met the Smiths. I find all these little parties\r\nvery pleasant. I like Mrs. S.; Miss Beaty is\r\ngood-humor itself, and does not seem much besides.\r\nWe spend to-morrow evening with them,\r\nand are to meet the Coln. and Mrs. Cantelo Smith\r\nyou have been used to hear of, and, if she is in\r\ngood humor, are likely to have excellent singing.\n\nTo-night I might have been at the play; Henry\r\nhad kindly planned our going together to the Lyceum,\r\nbut I have a cold which I should not like to\r\nmake worse before Saturday, so I stay within all\r\nthis day.\nEliza is walking out by herself. She has plenty\r\nof business on her hands just now, for the day of\r\nthe party is settled, and drawing near. Above\r\neighty people are invited for next Tuesday evening,\r\nand there is to be some very good music,\xe2\x80\x94five\r\nprofessionals, three of them glee singers, besides\r\namateurs. Fanny will listen to this. One of the\r\nhirelings is a Capital on the harp, from which I\r\nexpect great pleasure. The foundation of the\r\nparty was a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry\r\nWalter, but the latter leaves town the day before.\r\nI am sorry, as I wished her prejudice to be done\r\naway, but should have been more sorry if there had\r\nbeen no invitation.\nI am a wretch, to be so occupied with all these\r\nthings as to seem to have no thoughts to give to\r\npeople and circumstances which really supply a far\r\nmore lasting interest,\xe2\x80\x94the society in which you\r\nare; but I do think of you all, I assure you, and\r\nwant to know all about everybody, and especially\r\nabout your visit to the W. Friars; mais le moyen\r\nnot to be occupied by one\'s own concerns?\nSaturday.\xe2\x80\x94Frank is superseded in the "Caledonia."\r\nHenry brought us this news yesterday\r\nfrom Mr. Daysh, and he heard at the same time\r\nthat Charles may be in England in the course of a\r\nmonth. Sir Edward Pollen succeeds Lord Gambier\r\nin his command, and some captain of his succeeds\r\nFrank; and I believe the order is already gone\r\nout. Henry means to inquire further to-day. He\r\nwrote to Mary on the occasion. This is something\r\nto think of. Henry is convinced that he will have\r\nthe offer of something else, but does not think it\r\nwill be at all incumbent on him to accept it; and\r\nthen follows, what will he do? and where will he\r\nlive?\nI hope to hear from you to-day. How are you\r\nas to health, strength, looks, etc.? I had a very\r\ncomfortable account from Chawton yesterday.\nIf the weather permits, Eliza and I walk into\r\nLondon this morning. She is in want of chimney\r\nlights for Tuesday, and I of an ounce of darning-cotton.\r\nShe has resolved not to venture to the\r\nplay to-night. The D\'Entraigues and Comte Julien\r\ncannot come to the party, which was at first a\r\ngrief, but she has since supplied herself so well\r\nwith performers that it is of no consequence; their\r\nnot coming has produced our going to them to-morrow\r\nevening, which I like the idea of. It will\r\nbe amusing to see the ways of a French circle.\nI wrote to Mrs. Hill a few days ago, and have\r\nreceived a most kind and satisfactory answer. Any\r\ntime the first week in May exactly suits her, and\r\ntherefore I consider my going as tolerably fixed. I\r\nshall leave Sloane Street on the 1st or 2d, and be\r\nready for James on the 9th, and, if his plan alters,\r\nI can take care of myself. I have explained\r\nmy views here, and everything is smooth and\r\npleasant; and Eliza talks kindly of conveying me\r\nto Streatham.\nWe met the Tilsons yesterday evening, but the\r\nsinging Smiths sent an excuse, which put our Mrs.\r\nSmith out of humor.\nWe are come back, after a good dose of\r\nwalking and coaching, and I have the pleasure of\r\nyour letter. I wish I had James\'s verses, but they\r\nwere left at Chawton. When I return thither, if\r\nMrs. K. will give me leave, I will send them to\r\nher.\nOur first object to-day was Henrietta St., to\r\nconsult with Henry in consequence of a very\r\nunlucky change of the play for this very night,\xe2\x80\x94"Hamlet"\r\ninstead of "King John,"\xe2\x80\x94and we\r\nare to go on Monday to "Macbeth" instead; but\r\nit is a disappointment to us both.\nLove to all.\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I can return the\r\ncompliment by thanking you for the unexpected\r\npleasure of your letter yesterday, and as I like\r\nunexpected pleasure, it made me very happy; and,\r\nindeed, you need not apologize for your letter in\r\nany respect, for it is all very fine, but not too fine,\r\nI hope, to be written again, or something like it.\nI think Edward will not suffer much longer\r\nfrom heat; by the look of things this morning I\r\nsuspect the weather is rising into the balsamic\r\nnorth-east. It has been hot here, as you may suppose,\r\nsince it was so hot with you, but I have not\r\nsuffered from it at all, nor felt it in such a degree\r\nas to make me imagine it would be anything in\r\nthe country. Everybody has talked of the heat,\r\nbut I set it all down to London.\nI give you joy of our new nephew, and hope if\r\nhe ever comes to be hanged it will not be till we\r\nare too old to care about it. It is a great comfort\r\nto have it so safely and speedily over. The Miss\r\nCurlings must be hard worked in writing so many\r\nletters, but the novelty of it may recommend it to\r\nthem; mine was from Miss Eliza, and she says\r\nthat my brother may arrive to-day.\n\nNo, indeed, I am never too busy to think of\r\nS. and S. I can no more forget it than a mother\r\ncan forget her sucking child; and I am much\r\nobliged to you for your inquiries. I have had\r\ntwo sheets to correct, but the last only brings us\r\nto Willoughby\'s first appearance. Mrs. K. regrets\r\nin the most flattering manner that she must wait\r\ntill May, but I have scarcely a hope of its being\r\nout in June. Henry does not neglect it; he has\r\nhurried the printer, and says he will see him again\r\nto-day. It will not stand still during his absence,\r\nit will be sent to Eliza.\nThe Incomes remain as they were, but I will\r\nget them altered if I can. I am very much gratified\r\nby Mrs. K.\'s interest in it; and whatever may\r\nbe the event of it as to my credit with her, sincerely\r\nwish her curiosity could be satisfied sooner\r\nthan is now probable. I think she will like my\r\nElinor, but cannot build on anything else.\nOur party went off extremely well. There were\r\nmany solicitudes, alarms, and vexations beforehand,\r\nof course, but at last everything was quite\r\nright. The rooms were dressed up with flowers,\r\netc., and looked very pretty. A glass for the\r\nmantelpiece was lent by the man who is making\r\ntheir own. Mr. Egerton and Mr. Walter came at\r\nhalf-past five, and the festivities began with a pair\r\nof very fine soles.\n\nYes, Mr. Walter\xe2\x80\x94for he postponed his leaving\r\nLondon on purpose\xe2\x80\x94which did not give much\r\npleasure at the time, any more than the circumstance\r\nfrom which it rose,\xe2\x80\x94his calling on Sunday\r\nand being asked by Henry to take the family dinner\r\non that day, which he did; but it is all smoothed\r\nover now, and she likes him very well.\nAt half-past seven arrived the musicians in two\r\nhackney coaches, and by eight the lordly company\r\nbegan to appear. Among the earliest were George\r\nand Mary Cooke, and I spent the greatest part of\r\nthe evening very pleasantly with them. The\r\ndrawing-room being soon hotter than we liked, we\r\nplaced ourselves in the connecting passage, which\r\nwas comparatively cool, and gave us all the advantage\r\nof the music at a pleasant distance, as well as\r\nthat of the first view of every new-comer.\nI was quite surrounded by acquaintance, especially\r\ngentlemen; and what with Mr. Hampson,\r\nMr. Seymour, Mr. W. Knatchbull, Mr. Guillemarde,\r\nMr. Cure, a Captain Simpson, brother to the\r\nCaptain Simpson, besides Mr. Walter and Mr.\r\nEgerton, in addition to the Cookes, and Miss\r\nBeckford, and Miss Middleton, I had quite as\r\nmuch upon my hands as I could do.\nPoor Miss B. has been suffering again from her\r\nold complaint, and looks thinner than ever. She\r\ncertainly goes to Cheltenham the beginning of\r\nJune. We were all delight and cordiality, of\r\ncourse. Miss M. seems very happy, but has not\r\nbeauty enough to figure in London.\nIncluding everybody we were sixty-six,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas considerably more than Eliza had expected,\r\nand quite enough to fill the back drawing-room\r\nand leave a few to be scattered about in the other\r\nand in the passage.\nThe music was extremely good. It opened (tell\r\nFanny) with "Poike de Parp pirs praise pof Prapela;"\r\nand of the other glees I remember, "In\r\npeace love tunes," "Rosabelle," "The Red Cross\r\nKnight," and "Poor Insect." Between the songs\r\nwere lessons on the harp, or harp and pianoforte\r\ntogether; and the harp-player was Wiepart, whose\r\nname seems famous, though new to me. There\r\nwas one female singer, a short Miss Davis, all in\r\nblue, bringing up for the public line, whose voice\r\nwas said to be very fine indeed; and all the performers\r\ngave great satisfaction by doing what they\r\nwere paid for, and giving themselves no airs. No\r\namateur could be persuaded to do anything.\nThe house was not clear till after twelve. If\r\nyou wish to hear more of it, you must put your\r\nquestions, but I seem rather to have exhausted\r\nthan spared the subject.\nThis said Captain Simpson told us, on the authority\r\nof some other Captain just arrived from\r\nHalifax, that Charles was bringing the "Cleopatra"\r\nhome, and that she was probably by this\r\ntime in the Channel; but as Captain S. was\r\ncertainly in liquor, we must not quite depend\r\non it. It must give one a sort of expectation,\r\nhowever, and will prevent my writing to him any\r\nmore. I would rather he should not reach England\r\ntill I am at home, and the Steventon party\r\ngone.\nMy mother and Martha both write with great\r\nsatisfaction of Anna\'s behavior. She is quite an\r\nAnna with variations, but she cannot have reached\r\nher last, for that is always the most flourishing and\r\nshowy; she is at about her third or fourth, which\r\nare generally simple and pretty.\nYour lilacs are in leaf, ours are in bloom. The\r\nhorse-chestnuts are quite out, and the elms almost.\r\nI had a pleasant walk in Kensington Gardens on\r\nSunday with Henry, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Tilson;\r\neverything was fresh and beautiful.\nWe did go to the play, after all, on Saturday.\r\nWe went to the Lyceum, and saw the "Hypocrite,"\r\nan old play taken from Moli\xc3\xa8re\'s "Tartuffe," and\r\nwere well entertained. Dowton and Mathews were\r\nthe good actors; Mrs. Edwin was the heroine, and\r\nher performance is just what it used to be. I have\r\nno chance of seeing Mrs. Siddons; she did act on\r\nMonday, but as Henry was told by the box-keeper\r\nthat he did not think she would, the plans,\r\nand all thought of it, were given up. I should\r\nparticularly have liked seeing her in "Constance,"\r\nand could swear at her with little effort for disappointing\r\nme.\nHenry has been to the Water-Color Exhibition,\r\nwhich opened on Monday, and is to meet us there\r\nagain some morning. If Eliza cannot go (and she\r\nhas a cold at present), Miss Beaty will be invited\r\nto be my companion. Henry leaves town on Sunday\r\nafternoon, but he means to write soon himself\r\nto Edward, and will tell his own plans.\nThe tea is this moment setting out.\nDo not have your colored muslin unless you\r\nreally want it, because I am afraid I could not send\r\nit to the coach without giving trouble here.\nEliza caught her cold on Sunday in our way to\r\nthe D\'Entraigues. The horses actually gibbed on\r\nthis side of Hyde Park Gate: a load of fresh gravel\r\nmade it a formidable hill to them, and they refused\r\nthe collar; I believe there was a sore shoulder to\r\nirritate. Eliza was frightened, and we got out, and\r\nwere detained in the evening air several minutes.\r\nThe cold is in her chest, but she takes care of herself,\r\nand I hope it may not last long.\nThis engagement prevented Mr. Walter\'s staying\r\nlate,\xe2\x80\x94he had his coffee and went away. Eliza\r\nenjoyed her evening very much, and means to cultivate\r\nthe acquaintance; and I see nothing to dislike\r\nin them but their taking quantities of snuff.\r\nMonsieur, the old Count, is a very fine-looking\r\nman, with quiet manners, good enough for an Englishman,\r\nand, I believe, is a man of great information\r\nand taste. He has some fine paintings, which\r\ndelighted Henry as much as the son\'s music gratified\r\nEliza; and among them a miniature of Philip\r\nV. of Spain, Louis XIV.\'s grandson, which exactly\r\nsuited my capacity. Count Julien\'s performance\r\nis very wonderful.\nWe met only Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, and\r\nwe are just now engaged to spend next Sunday\r\nevening at Mrs. L.\'s, and to meet the D\'Entraigues,\r\nbut M. le Comte must do without Henry. If he\r\nwould but speak English, I would take to him.\nHave you ever mentioned the leaving off tea to\r\nMrs. K.? Eliza has just spoken of it again. The\r\nbenefit she has found from it in sleeping has been\r\nvery great.\nI shall write soon to Catherine to fix my day,\r\nwhich will be Thursday. We have no engagement\r\nbut for Sunday. Eliza\'s cold makes quiet advisable.\r\nHer party is mentioned in this morning\'s\r\npaper. I am sorry to hear of poor Fanny\'s state.\r\nFrom that quarter, I suppose, is to be the alloy of\r\nher happiness. I will have no more to say.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I had sent off my\r\nletter yesterday before yours came, which I was\r\nsorry for; but as Eliza has been so good as to get\r\nme a frank, your questions shall be answered without\r\nmuch further expense to you.\nThe best direction to Henry at Oxford will be\r\n"The Blue Boar, Cornmarket."\nI do not mean to provide another trimming for\r\nmy pelisse, for I am determined to spend no more\r\nmoney; so I shall wear it as it is, longer than I\r\nought, and then\xe2\x80\x94I do not know.\nMy head-dress was a bugle-band like the border\r\nto my gown, and a flower of Mrs. Tilson\'s. I depended\r\nupon hearing something of the evening\r\nfrom Mr. W. K., and am very well satisfied with\r\nhis notice of me\xe2\x80\x94"A pleasing-looking young\r\nwoman"\xe2\x80\x94that must do; one cannot pretend to\r\nanything better now; thankful to have it continued\r\na few years longer!\nIt gives me sincere pleasure to hear of Mrs.\r\nKnight\'s having had a tolerable night at last, but\r\nupon this occasion I wish she had another name,\r\nfor the two nights jingle very much.\nWe have tried to get "Self-control," but in vain.\r\nI should like to know what her estimate is, but am\r\nalways half afraid of finding a clever novel too\r\nclever, and of finding my own story and my own\r\npeople all forestalled.\nEliza has just received a few lines from Henry\r\nto assure her of the good conduct of his mare.\r\nHe slept at Uxbridge on Sunday, and wrote from\r\nWheatfield.\nWe were not claimed by Hans Place yesterday,\r\nbut are to dine there to-day. Mr. Tilson called\r\nin the evening, but otherwise we were quite alone\r\nall day; and after having been out a good deal,\r\nthe change was very pleasant.\nI like your opinion of Miss Atten much better\r\nthan I expected, and have now hopes of her staying\r\na whole twelvemonth. By this time I suppose\r\nshe is hard at it, governing away. Poor creature!\r\nI pity her, though they are my nieces.\nOh! yes, I remember Miss Emma Plumbtree\'s\r\nlocal consequence perfectly.\nIt was a mistake of mine, my dear Cassandra,\r\nto talk of a tenth child at Hamstall. I had forgot\r\nthere were but eight already.\nYour inquiry after my uncle and aunt were most\r\nhappily timed, for the very same post brought an\r\naccount of them. They are again at Gloucester\r\nHouse enjoying fresh air, which they seem to have\r\nfelt the want of in Bath, and are tolerably well,\r\nbut not more than tolerable. My aunt does not\r\nenter into particulars, but she does not write in\r\nspirits, and we imagine that she has never entirely\r\ngot the better of her disorder in the winter. Mrs.\r\nWelby takes her out airing in her barouche, which\r\ngives her a headache,\xe2\x80\x94a comfortable proof, I suppose,\r\nof the uselessness of the new carriage when\r\nthey have got it.\nYou certainly must have heard before I can tell\r\nyou that Col. Orde has married our cousin Margt.\r\nBeckford, the Marchess. of Douglas\'s sister. The\r\npapers say that her father disinherits her, but I\r\nthink too well of an Orde to suppose that she has\r\nnot a handsome independence of her own.\nBy this time, my dearest Cassandra, you know\r\nMartha\'s plans. I was rather disappointed, I\r\nconfess, to find that she could not leave town till\r\nafter ye 24th, as I had hoped to see you here the\r\nweek before. The delay, however, is not great,\r\nand everything seems generally arranging itself for\r\nyour return very comfortably.\nI found Henry perfectly predisposed to bring\r\nyou to London if agreeable to yourself; he has\r\nnot fixed his day for going into Kent, but he must\r\nbe back again before ye 20th. You may therefore\r\nthink with something like certainty of the close\r\nof your Godmersham visit, and will have, I suppose,\r\nabout a week for Sloane Street. He travels in his\r\ngig, and should the weather be tolerable I think\r\nyou must have a delightful journey.\nI have given up all idea of Miss Sharpe\'s travelling\r\nwith you and Martha, for though you are both\r\nall compliance with my scheme, yet as you knock\r\noff a week from the end of her visit, and Martha\r\nrather more from the beginning, the thing is out\r\nof the question.\nI have written to her to say that after the middle\r\nof July we shall be happy to receive her, and I\r\nhave added a welcome if she could make her way\r\nhither directly, but I do not expect that she will.\r\nI have also sent our invitation to Cowes.\nWe are very sorry for the disappointment you\r\nhave all had in Lady B.\'s illness; but a division of\r\nthe proposed party is with you by this time, and\r\nI hope may have brought you a better account of\r\nthe rest.\n\nGive my love and thanks to Harriot, who has\r\nwritten me charming things of your looks, and\r\ndiverted me very much by poor Mrs. C. Milles\'s\r\ncontinued perplexity.\nI had a few lines from Henry on Tuesday to\r\nprepare us for himself and his friend, and by the\r\ntime that I had made the sumptuous provision of\r\na neck of mutton on the occasion, they drove into\r\nthe court; but lest you should not immediately\r\nrecollect in how many hours a neck of mutton\r\nmay be certainly procured, I add that they came\r\na little after twelve,\xe2\x80\x94both tall and well, and in\r\ntheir different degrees agreeable.\nIt was a visit of only twenty-four hours, but\r\nvery pleasant while it lasted. Mr. Tilson took a\r\nsketch of the Great House before dinner, and after\r\ndinner we all three walked to Chawton Park,\r\nmeaning to go into it, but it was too dirty, and we\r\nwere obliged to keep on the outside. Mr. Tilson\r\nadmired the trees very much, but grieved that they\r\nshould not be turned into money.\nMy mother\'s cold is better, and I believe she\r\nonly wants dry weather to be very well. It was a\r\ngreat distress to her that Anna should be absent\r\nduring her uncle\'s visit, a distress which I could\r\nnot share. She does not return from Faringdon\r\ntill this evening, and I doubt not has had plenty\r\nof the miscellaneous, unsettled sort of happiness\r\nwhich seems to suit her best. We hear from Miss\r\nBenn, who was on the Common with the Prowtings,\r\nthat she was very much admired by the gentlemen\r\nin general.\nI like your new bonnets exceedingly; yours is a\r\nshape which always looks well, and I think Fanny\'s\r\nparticularly becoming to her.\nOn Monday I had the pleasure of receiving, unpacking,\r\nand approving our Wedgwood ware. It\r\nall came very safely, and upon the whole is a good\r\nmatch, though I think they might have allowed\r\nus rather larger leaves, especially in such a year\r\nof fine foliage as this. One is apt to suppose that\r\nthe woods about Birmingham must be blighted.\r\nThere was no bill with the goods, but that shall\r\nnot screen them from being paid. I mean to ask\r\nMartha to settle the account. It will be quite in\r\nher way, for she is just now sending my mother a\r\nbreakfast-set from the same place.\nI hope it will come by the wagon to-morrow; it\r\nis certainly what we want, and I long to know\r\nwhat it is like, and as I am sure Martha has great\r\npleasure in making the present, I will not have\r\nany regret. We have considerable dealings with\r\nthe wagons at present: a hamper of port and brandy\r\nfrom Southampton is now in the kitchen.\nYour answer about the Miss Plumbtrees proves\r\nyou as fine a Daniel as ever Portia was; for I\r\nmaintained Emma to be the eldest.\n\nWe began pease on Sunday, but our gatherings\r\nare very small, not at all like the gathering in the\r\n"Lady of the Lake." Yesterday I had the agreeable\r\nsurprise of finding several scarlet strawberries\r\nquite ripe; had you been at home, this would have\r\nbeen a pleasure lost. There are more gooseberries\r\nand fewer currants than I thought at first. We\r\nmust buy currants for our wine.\nThe Digweeds are gone down to see the Stephen\r\nTerrys at Southampton, and catch the King\'s\r\nbirthday at Portsmouth. Miss Papillon called on\r\nus yesterday, looking handsomer than ever. Maria\r\nMiddleton and Miss Benn dine here to-morrow.\nWe are not to enclose any more letters to\r\nAbingdon Street, as perhaps Martha has told\r\nyou.\nI had just left off writing and put on my things\r\nfor walking to Alton, when Anna and her friend\r\nHarriot called in their way thither; so we went\r\ntogether. Their business was to provide mourning\r\nagainst the King\'s death, and my mother has had\r\na bombazine bought for her. I am not sorry to be\r\nback again, for the young ladies had a great deal\r\nto do, and without much method in doing it.\nAnna does not come home till to-morrow morning.\r\nShe has written I find to Fanny, but there\r\ndoes not seem to be a great deal to relate of Tuesday.\r\nI had hoped there might be dancing.\nMrs. Budd died on Sunday evening. I saw\r\nher two days before her death, and thought it must\r\nhappen soon. She suffered much from weakness\r\nand restlessness almost to the last. Poor little\r\nHarriot seems truly grieved. You have never\r\nmentioned Harry; how is he?\nWith love to you all,\nI hope you received my little parcel by J. Bond\r\non Wednesday evening, my dear Cassandra, and\r\nthat you will be ready to hear from me again on\r\nSunday, for I feel that I must write to you to-day.\r\nI want to tell you that I have got my own darling\r\nchild from London. On Wednesday I received\r\none copy sent down by Falkener, with three lines\r\nfrom Henry to say that he had given another\r\nto Charles and sent a third by the coach to\r\nGodmersham.... The advertisement is in our\r\npaper to-day for the first time: 18s. He shall ask\r\n1l. 1s. for my two next, and 1l. 8s. for my\r\nstupidest of all. Miss B. dined with us on the\r\nvery day of the book\'s coming, and in the evening\r\nwe fairly set at it, and read half the first vol. to\r\nher, prefacing that, having intelligence from\r\nHenry that such a work would soon appear, we\r\nhad desired him to send it whenever it came out,\r\nand I believe it passed with her unsuspected.\r\nShe was amused, poor soul! That she could not\r\nhelp, you know, with two such people to lead the\r\nway; but she really does seem to admire Elizabeth.\r\nI must confess that I think her as delightful a\r\ncreature as ever appeared in print, and how I shall\r\nbe able to tolerate those who do not like her at\r\nleast, I do not know. There are a few typical\r\nerrors; and a "said he," or a "said she," would\r\nsometimes make the dialogue more immediately\r\nclear; but "I do not write for such dull elves"\r\nas have not a great deal of ingenuity themselves.\r\nThe second volume is shorter than I could wish,\r\nbut the difference is not so much in reality as in\r\nlook, there being a larger proportion of narrative\r\nin that part. I have lop\'t and crop\'t so successfully,\r\nhowever, that I imagine it must be rather\r\nshorter than "Sense and Sensibility" altogether.\r\nNow I will try and write of something else.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Your letter was truly\r\nwelcome, and I am much obliged to you for all\r\nyour praise; it came at a right time, for I had had\r\nsome fits of disgust. Our second evening\'s reading\r\nto Miss B. had not pleased me so well, but\r\nI believe something must be attributed to my\r\nmother\'s too rapid way of getting on: though she\r\nperfectly understands the characters herself, she\r\ncannot speak as they ought. Upon the whole,\r\nhowever, I am quite vain enough and well satisfied\r\nenough. The work is rather too light and bright\r\nand sparkling: it wants shade; it wants to be\r\nstretched out here and there with a long chapter of\r\nsense, if it could be had; if not, of solemn specious\r\nnonsense, about something unconnected with the\r\nstory,\xe2\x80\x94an essay on writing, a critique on Walter\r\nScott, or the history of Buonaparte, or something\r\nthat would form a contrast, and bring the reader\r\nwith increased delight to the playfulness and\r\nepigrammatism of the general style.... The\r\ngreatest blunder in the printing that I have met\r\nwith is in page 220, v. 3, where two speeches are\r\nmade into one. There might as well be no suppers\r\nat Longbourn; but I suppose it was the remains of\r\nMrs. Bennet\'s old Meryton habits.\nThis will be a quick return for yours, my dear\r\nCassandra. I doubt its having much else to recommend\r\nit; but there is no saying: it may turn out\r\nto be a very long and delightful letter. I am exceedingly\r\npleased that you can say what you do, after\r\nhaving gone through the whole work, and Fanny\'s\r\npraise is very gratifying. My hopes were tolerably\r\nstrong of her, but nothing like a certainty. Her\r\nliking Darcy and Elizabeth is enough. She might\r\nhate all the others, if she would. I have her\r\nopinion under her own hand this morning; but\r\nyour transcript of it, which I read first, was not,\r\nand is not, the less acceptable. To me it is of\r\ncourse all praise, but the more exact truth which\r\nshe sends you is good enough.... Our party\r\non Wednesday was not unagreeable, though we\r\nwanted a master of the house less anxious and\r\nfidgety, and more conversable. Upon Mrs. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\'s\r\nmentioning that she had sent the rejected addresses\r\nto Mrs. H., I began talking to her a little\r\nabout them, and expressed my hope of their having\r\namused her. Her answer was, "Oh dear, yes,\r\nvery much, very droll indeed, the opening of the\r\nhouse, and the striking up of the fiddles!" What\r\nshe meant, poor woman, who shall say? I sought\r\nno farther. As soon as a whist-party was formed,\r\nand a round table threatened, I made my mother\r\nan excuse and came away, leaving just as many\r\nfor their round table as there were at Mrs.\r\nGrant\'s. I wish they might be as agreeable a\r\nset. My mother is very well, and finds great\r\namusement in glove-knitting, and at present wants\r\nno other work. We quite run over with books.\r\nShe has got Sir John Carr\'s "Travels in Spain,"\r\nand I am reading a Society octavo, an "Essay on\r\nthe Military Police and Institutions of the British\r\nEmpire," by Capt. Pasley of the Engineers,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nbook which I protested against at first, but which\r\nupon trial I find delightfully written and highly\r\nentertaining. I am as much in love with the\r\nauthor as I ever was with Clarkson or Buchanan,\r\nor even the two Mr. Smiths of the city. The first\r\nsoldier I ever sighed for; but he does write with\r\nextraordinary force and spirit. Yesterday, moreover,\r\nbrought us "Mrs. Grant\'s Letters," with\r\nMr. White\'s compliments; but I have disposed of\r\nthem, compliments and all, to Miss P., and\r\namongst so many readers or retainers of books as\r\nwe have in Chawton, I dare say there will be no\r\ndifficulty in getting rid of them for another fortnight,\r\nif necessary. I have disposed of Mrs.\r\nGrant for the second fortnight to Mrs. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. It\r\ncan make no difference to her which of the twenty-six\r\nfortnights in the year the three vols. lie on her\r\ntable. I have been applied to for information as\r\nto the oath taken in former times of Bell, Book,\r\nand Candle, but have none to give. Perhaps you\r\nmay be able to learn something of its origin where\r\nyou now are. Ladies who read those enormous\r\ngreat stupid thick quarto volumes which one always\r\nsees in the breakfast-parlor there must be\r\nacquainted with everything in the world. I detest\r\na quarto. Captain Pasley\'s book is too good\r\nfor their society. They will not understand a man\r\nwho condenses his thoughts into an octavo. I have\r\nlearned from Sir J. Carr that there is no Government\r\nHouse at Gibraltar. I must alter it to the\r\nCommissioner\'s.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Before I say anything\r\nelse, I claim a paper full of halfpence on\r\nthe drawing-room mantelpiece; I put them there\r\nmyself, and forgot to bring them with me. I\r\ncannot say that I have yet been in any distress\r\nfor money, but I choose to have my due, as well\r\nas the Devil. How lucky we were in our weather\r\nyesterday! This wet morning makes one more\r\nsensible of it. We had no rain of any consequence.\r\nThe head of the curricle was put half up\r\nthree or four times, but our share of the showers\r\nwas very trifling, though they seemed to be heavy\r\nall round us, when we were on the Hog\'s-back,\r\nand I fancied it might then be raining so hard\r\nat Chawton as to make you feel for us much more\r\nthan we deserved. Three hours and a quarter\r\ntook us to Guildford, where we stayed barely two\r\nhours, and had only just time enough for all we\r\nhad to do there; that is, eating a long and comfortable\r\nbreakfast, watching the carriages, paying\r\nMr. Harrington, and taking a little stroll afterwards.\r\nFrom some views which that stroll gave\r\nus, I think most highly of the situation of Guildford.\r\nWe wanted all our brothers and sisters to\r\nbe standing with us in the bowling-green, and\r\nlooking towards Horsham. I was very lucky in\r\nmy gloves,\xe2\x80\x94got them at the first shop I went\r\nto, though I went into it rather because it was\r\nnear than because it looked at all like a glove-shop,\r\nand gave only four shillings for them; after\r\nwhich everybody at Chawton will be hoping and\r\npredicting that they cannot be good for anything,\r\nand their worth certainly remains to be proved; but\r\nI think they look very well. We left Guildford at\r\ntwenty minutes before twelve (I hope somebody\r\ncares for these minuti\xc3\xa6), and were at Esher\r\nin about two hours more. I was very much\r\npleased with the country in general. Between\r\nGuildford and Ripley I thought it particularly\r\npretty, also about Painshill; and from a Mr.\r\nSpicer\'s grounds at Esher, which we walked into\r\nbefore dinner, the views were beautiful. I cannot\r\nsay what we did not see, but I should think there\r\ncould not be a wood, or a meadow, or palace, or\r\nremarkable spot in England that was not spread\r\nout before us on one side or other. Claremont\r\nis going to be sold: a Mr. Ellis has it now. It\r\nis a house that seems never to have prospered.\r\nAfter dinner we walked forward to be overtaken\r\nat the coachman\'s time, and before he did overtake\r\nus we were very near Kingston. I fancy\r\nit was about half-past six when we reached this\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x94a twelve hours\' business, and the horses\r\ndid not appear more than reasonably tired. I\r\nwas very tired too, and glad to get to bed early,\r\nbut am quite well to-day. I am very snug in\r\nthe front drawing-room all to myself, and would\r\nnot say "thank you" for any company but you.\r\nThe quietness of it does me good. I have contrived\r\nto pay my two visits, though the weather\r\nmade me a great while about it, and left me only\r\na few minutes to sit with Charlotte Craven. She\r\nlooks very well, and her hair is done up with an\r\nelegance to do credit to any education. Her manners\r\nare as unaffected and pleasing as ever. She\r\nhad heard from her mother to-day. Mrs. Craven\r\nspends another fortnight at Chilton. I saw nobody\r\nbut Charlotte, which pleased me best. I\r\nwas shown upstairs into a drawing-room, where\r\nshe came to me; and the appearance of the room,\r\nso totally unschoollike, amused me very much: it\r\nwas full of modern elegances.\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I am very much\r\nobliged to you for writing to me. You must have\r\nhated it after a worrying morning. Your letter\r\ncame just in time to save my going to Remnant\'s,\r\nand fit me for Christian\'s, where I bought Fanny\'s\r\ndimity.\nI went the day before (Friday) to Layton\'s as\r\nI proposed, and got my mother\'s gown,\xe2\x80\x94seven\r\nyards at 6s. 6d. I then walked into No. 10, which\r\nis all dirt and confusion, but in a very promising\r\nway; and after being present at the opening of\r\na new account, to my great amusement, Henry\r\nand I went to the exhibition in Spring Gardens.\r\nIt is not thought a good collection, but I was\r\nvery well pleased, particularly (pray tell Fanny)\r\nwith a small portrait of Mrs. Bingley, excessively\r\nlike her.\nI went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but\r\nthere was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps, however, I\r\nmay find her in the great exhibition, which we\r\nshall go to if we have time. I have no chance of her\r\nin the collection of Sir Joshua Reynolds\'s paintings,\r\nwhich is now showing in Pall Mall, and\r\nwhich we are also to visit.\n\nMrs. Bingley\'s is exactly herself,\xe2\x80\x94size, shaped\r\nface, features, and sweetness; there never was a\r\ngreater likeness. She is dressed in a white gown,\r\nwith green ornaments, which convinces me of\r\nwhat I had always supposed, that green was a\r\nfavorite color with her. I dare say Mrs. D. will\r\nbe in yellow.\nFriday was our worst day as to weather. We\r\nwere out in a very long and very heavy storm of\r\nhail, and there had been others before, but I\r\nheard no thunder. Saturday was a good deal\r\nbetter; dry and cold.\nI gave 2s. 6d. for the dimity. I do not boast\r\nof any bargains, but think both the sarsenet and\r\ndimity good of their sort.\nI have bought your locket, but was obliged to\r\ngive 18s. for it, which must be rather more than\r\nyou intended. It is neat and plain, set in gold.\nWe were to have gone to the Somerset House\r\nExhibition on Saturday, but when I reached Henrietta\r\nStreet Mr. Hampson was wanted there, and\r\nMr. Tilson and I were obliged to drive about\r\ntown after him, and by the time we had done it\r\nwas too late for anything but home. We never\r\nfound him after all.\nI have been interrupted by Mrs. Tilson. Poor\r\nwoman! She is in danger of not being able to\r\nattend Lady Drummond Smith\'s party to-night.\r\nMiss Burdett was to have taken her, and now\r\nMiss Burdett has a cough and will not go. My\r\ncousin Caroline is her sole dependence.\nThe events of yesterday were, our going to Belgrave\r\nChapel in the morning, our being prevented\r\nby the rain from going to evening service at St.\r\nJames, Mr. Hampson\'s calling, Messrs. Barlow\r\nand Phillips dining here, and Mr. and Mrs. Tilson\'s\r\ncoming in the evening \xc3\xa0 l\'ordinaire. She\r\ndrank tea with us both Thursday and Saturday;\r\nhe dined out each day, and on Friday we were with\r\nthem, and they wish us to go to them to-morrow\r\nevening, to meet Miss Burdett, but I do not know\r\nhow it will end. Henry talks of a drive to Hampstead,\r\nwhich may interfere with it.\nI should like to see Miss Burdett very well,\r\nbut that I am rather frightened by hearing that\r\nshe wishes to be introduced to me. If I am a\r\nwild beast, I cannot help it. It is not my own\r\nfault.\nThere is no change in our plan of leaving London,\r\nbut we shall not be with you before Tuesday.\r\nHenry thinks Monday would appear too early a\r\nday. There is no danger of our being induced to\r\nstay longer.\nI have not quite determined how I shall manage\r\nabout my clothes; perhaps there may be only my\r\ntrunk to send by the coach, or there may be a\r\nband-box with it. I have taken your gentle hint,\r\nand written to Mrs. Hill.\n\nThe Hoblyns want us to dine with them, but we\r\nhave refused. When Henry returns he will be\r\ndining out a great deal, I dare say; as he will then\r\nbe alone, it will be more desirable; he will be\r\nmore welcome at every table, and every invitation\r\nmore welcome to him. He will not want either of\r\nus again till he is settled in Henrietta Street.\r\nThis is my present persuasion. And he will not\r\nbe settled there\xe2\x80\x94really settled\xe2\x80\x94till late in the\r\nautumn; "he will not be come to bide" till after\r\nSeptember.\nThere is a gentleman in treaty for this house.\r\nGentleman himself is in the country, but gentleman\'s\r\nfriend came to see it the other day, and\r\nseemed pleased on the whole. Gentleman would\r\nrather prefer an increased rent to parting with five\r\nhundred guineas at once, and if that is the only\r\ndifficulty it will not be minded. Henry is indifferent\r\nas to the which.\nGet us the best weather you can for Wednesday,\r\nThursday, and Friday. We are to go to Windsor\r\nin our way to Henley, which will be a great\r\ndelight. We shall be leaving Sloane Street\r\nabout twelve, two or three hours after Charles\'s\r\nparty have begun their journey. You will\r\nmiss them, but the comfort of getting back into\r\nyour own room will be great. And then the tea\r\nand sugar!\nI fear Miss Clewes is not better, or you would\r\nhave mentioned it. I shall not write again unless\r\nI have any unexpected communication or opportunity\r\nto tempt me. I enclose Mr. Herington\'s\r\nbill and receipt.\nI am very much obliged to Fanny for her letter;\r\nit made me laugh heartily, but I cannot pretend\r\nto answer it. Even had I more time, I should\r\nnot feel at all sure of the sort of letter that Miss\r\nD. would write. I hope Miss Benn is got well\r\nagain, and will have a comfortable dinner with you\r\nto-day.\nMonday Evening.\xe2\x80\x94We have been both to the\r\nexhibition and Sir J. Reynolds\'s, and I am disappointed,\r\nfor there was nothing like Mrs. D. at\r\neither. I can only imagine that Mr. D. prizes\r\nany picture of her too much to like it should be\r\nexposed to the public eye. I can imagine he\r\nwould have that sort of feeling,\xe2\x80\x94that mixture of\r\nlove, pride, and delicacy.\nSetting aside this disappointment, I had great\r\namusement among the pictures; and the driving\r\nabout, the carriage being open, was very pleasant.\r\nI liked my solitary elegance very much, and was\r\nready to laugh all the time at my being where I\r\nwas. I could not but feel that I had naturally\r\nsmall right to be parading about London in a\r\nbarouche.\nHenry desires Edward may know that he has\r\njust bought three dozen of claret for him (cheap),\r\nand ordered it to be sent down to Chawton.\nI should not wonder if we got no farther than\r\nReading on Thursday evening, and so reach Steventon\r\nonly to a reasonable dinner-hour the next\r\nday; but whatever I may write or you may imagine,\r\nwe know it will be something different. I\r\nshall be quiet to-morrow morning; all my business\r\nis done, and I shall only call again upon\r\nMrs. Hoblyn, etc.\nLove to your much ... party.\nHere I am, my dearest Cassandra, seated in the\r\nbreakfast, dining, sitting room, beginning with all\r\nmy might. Fanny will join me as soon as she is\r\ndressed, and begin her letter.\nWe had a very good journey, weather and roads\r\nexcellent; the three first stages for 1s. 6d., and\r\nour only misadventure the being delayed about a\r\nquarter of an hour at Kingston for horses, and\r\nbeing obliged to put up with a pair belonging to a\r\nhackney coach and their coachman, which left no\r\nroom on the barouche box for Lizzy, who was to\r\nhave gone her last stage there as she did the first;\r\nconsequently we were all four within, which was a\r\nlittle crowded.\nWe arrived at a quarter-past four, and were\r\nkindly welcomed by the coachman, and then by\r\nhis master, and then by William, and then by Mrs.\r\nPengird, who all met us before we reached the foot\r\nof the stairs. Mde. Bigion was below dressing us\r\na most comfortable dinner of soup, fish, bouill\xc3\xa9e,\r\npartridges, and an apple tart, which we sat down\r\nto soon after five, after cleaning and dressing ourselves,\r\nand feeling that we were most commodiously\r\ndisposed of. The little adjoining dressing-room to\r\nour apartment makes Fanny and myself very well\r\noff indeed, and as we have poor Eliza\'s bed our\r\nspace is ample every way.\nSace arrived safely about half-past six. At\r\nseven we set off in a coach for the Lyceum; were\r\nat home again in about four hours and a half; had\r\nsoup and wine and water, and then went to our\r\nholes.\nEdward finds his quarters very snug and quiet.\r\nI must get a softer pen. This is harder. I am in\r\nagonies. I have not yet seen Mr. Crabbe. Martha\'s\r\nletter is gone to the post.\nI am going to write nothing but short sentences.\r\nThere shall be two full stops in every line. Layton\r\nand Shear\'s is Bedford House. We mean to\r\nget there before breakfast if it\'s possible; for we\r\nfeel more and more how much we have to do and\r\nhow little time. This house looks very nice. It\r\nseems like Sloane Street moved here. I believe\r\nHenry is just rid of Sloane Street. Fanny does\r\nnot come, but I have Edward seated by me beginning\r\na letter, which looks natural.\nHenry has been suffering from the pain in the\r\nface which he has been subject to before. He\r\ncaught cold at Matlock, and since his return has\r\nbeen paying a little for past pleasure. It is nearly\r\nremoved now, but he looks thin in the face, either\r\nfrom the pain or the fatigues of his tour, which\r\nmust have been great.\nLady Robert is delighted with P. and P., and\r\nreally was so, as I understand, before she knew\r\nwho wrote it, for of course she knows now.\r\nHe told her with as much satisfaction as if it were\r\nmy wish. He did not tell me this, but he told\r\nFanny. And Mr. Hastings! I am quite delighted\r\nwith what such a man writes about it.\r\nHenry sent him the books after his return from\r\nDaylesford, but you will hear the letter too.\nLet me be rational, and return to my two full\r\nstops.\nI talked to Henry at the play last night. We\r\nwere in a private box,\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Spencer\'s,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nmade it much more pleasant. The box is directly\r\non the stage. One is infinitely less fatigued\r\nthan in the common way. But Henry\'s\r\nplans are not what one could wish. He does not\r\nmean to be at Chawton till the 29th. He must be\r\nin town again by Oct. 5. His plan is to get a\r\ncouple of days of pheasant shooting and then return\r\ndirectly. His wish was to bring you back\r\nwith him. I have told him your scruples. He\r\nwishes you to suit yourself as to time, and if you\r\ncannot come till later, will send for you at any\r\ntime as far as Bagshot. He presumed you would\r\nnot find difficulty in getting so far. I could not\r\nsay you would. He proposed your going with him\r\ninto Oxfordshire. It was his own thought at first.\r\nI could not but catch at it for you.\nWe have talked of it again this morning (for\r\nnow we have breakfasted), and I am convinced that\r\nif you can make it suit in other respects you need\r\nnot scruple on his account. If you cannot come\r\nback with him on the 3rd or 4th, therefore, I do\r\nhope you will contrive to go to Adlestrop. By not\r\nbeginning your absence till about the middle of\r\nthis month I think you may manage it very well.\r\nBut you will think all this over. One could wish\r\nhe had intended to come to you earlier, but it cannot\r\nbe helped.\nI said nothing to him of Mrs. H. and Miss B.,\r\nthat he might not suppose difficulties. Shall not\r\nyou put them into our own room? This seems to\r\nme the best plan, and the maid will be most conveniently\r\nnear.\nOh, dear me! when I shall ever have done. We\r\ndid go to Layton and Shear\'s before breakfast.\r\nVery pretty English poplins at 4s. 3d.; Irish,\r\nditto at 6s.; more pretty, certainly,\xe2\x80\x94beautiful.\nFanny and the two little girls are gone to take\r\nplaces for to-night at Covent Garden; "Clandestine\r\nMarriage" and "Midas." The latter will be a\r\nfine show for L. and M. They revelled last night\r\nin "Don Juan," whom we left in hell at half-past\r\neleven. We had scaramouch and a ghost, and\r\nwere delighted. I speak of them; my delight\r\nwas very tranquil, and the rest of us were sober-minded.\r\n"Don Juan" was the last of three musical\r\nthings. "Five Hours at Brighton," in three\r\nacts,\xe2\x80\x94of which one was over before we arrived,\r\nnone the worse,\xe2\x80\x94and the "Beehive," rather less\r\nflat and trumpery.\nI have this moment received 5l. from kind, beautiful\r\nEdward. Fanny has a similar gift. I shall\r\nsave what I can of it for your better leisure in this\r\nplace. My letter was from Miss Sharpe,\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nparticular. A letter from Fanny Cage this morning.\nFour o\'clock.\xe2\x80\x94We are just come back from doing\r\nMrs. Tickars, Miss Hare, and Mr. Spence.\r\nMr. Hall is here, and while Fanny is under his\r\nhands, I will try to write a little more.\n\nMiss Hare had some pretty caps, and is to make\r\nme one like one of them, only white satin instead\r\nof blue. It will be white satin and lace, and a\r\nlittle white flower perking out of the left ear, like\r\nHarriot Byron\'s feather. I have allowed her to\r\ngo as far as 1l. 16s. My gown is to be trimmed\r\neverywhere with white ribbon plaited on somehow\r\nor other. She says it will look well. I am not\r\nsanguine. They trim with white very much.\nI learnt from Mrs. Tickars\'s young lady, to my\r\nhigh amusement, that the stays now are not made\r\nto force the bosom up at all; that was a very unbecoming,\r\nunnatural fashion. I was really glad\r\nto hear that they are not to be so much off the\r\nshoulders as they were.\nGoing to Mr. Spence\'s was a sad business, and\r\ncost us many tears; unluckily we were obliged to\r\ngo a second time before he could do more than just\r\nlook. We went first at half-past twelve and afterwards\r\nat three; papa with us each time; and, alas!\r\nwe are to go again to-morrow. Lizzy is not finished\r\nyet. There have been no teeth taken out,\r\nhowever, nor will be, I believe; but he finds hers\r\nin a very bad state, and seems to think particularly\r\nill of their durableness. They have been\r\nall cleaned, hers filed, and are to be filed again.\r\nThere is a very sad hole between two of her front\r\nteeth.\nThursday Morning, half-past Seven.\xe2\x80\x94Up and\r\ndressed and downstairs in order to finish my letter\r\nin time for the parcel. At eight I have an appointment\r\nwith Madame B., who wants to show me\r\nsomething downstairs. At nine we are to set off\r\nfor Grafton House, and get that over before breakfast.\r\nEdward is so kind as to walk there with us.\r\nWe are to be at Mr. Spence\'s again at 11.5: from\r\nthat time shall be driving about I suppose till four\r\no\'clock at least. We are, if possible, to call on\r\nMrs. Tilson.\nMr. Hall was very punctual yesterday, and\r\ncurled me out at a great rate. I thought it looked\r\nhideous, and longed for a snug cap instead, but my\r\ncompanions silenced me by their admiration. I\r\nhad only a bit of velvet round my head. I did not\r\ncatch cold, however. The weather is all in my\r\nfavor. I have had no pain in my face since I\r\nleft you.\nWe had very good places in the box next the\r\nstage-box, front and second row; the three old ones\r\nbehind, of course. I was particularly disappointed\r\nat seeing nothing of Mr. Crabbe. I felt sure of\r\nhim when I saw that the boxes were fitted up with\r\ncrimson velvet. The new Mr. Terry was Lord\r\nOgleby, and Henry thinks he may do; but there\r\nwas no acting more than moderate, and I was as\r\nmuch amused by the remembrances connected with\r\n"Midas" as with any part of it. The girls were\r\nvery much delighted, but still prefer "Don Juan;"\r\nand I must say that I have seen nobody on the\r\nstage who has been a more interesting character\r\nthan that compound of cruelty and lust.\nIt was not possible for me to get the worsteds\r\nyesterday. I heard Edward last night pressing\r\nHenry to come to you, and I think Henry engaged\r\nto go there after his November collection. Nothing\r\nhas been done as to S. and S. The books came to\r\nhand too late for him to have time for it before he\r\nwent. Mr. Hastings never hinted at Eliza in the\r\nsmallest degree. Henry knew nothing of Mr.\r\nTrimmer\'s death. I tell you these things that you\r\nmay not have to ask them over again.\nThere is a new clerk sent down to Alton, a Mr.\r\nEdmund Williams, a young man whom Henry\r\nthinks most highly of, and he turns out to be\r\na son of the luckless Williamses of Grosvenor\r\nPlace.\nI long to have you hear Mr. H.\'s opinion of\r\nP. and P. His admiring my Elizabeth so much is\r\nparticularly welcome to me.\nInstead of saving my superfluous wealth for you\r\nto spend, I am going to treat myself with spending\r\nit myself. I hope, at least, that I shall find some\r\npoplin at Layton and Shear\'s that will tempt me to\r\nbuy it. If I do, it shall be sent to Chawton, as\r\nhalf will be for you; for I depend upon your being\r\nso kind as to accept it, being the main point. It\r\nwill be a great pleasure to me. Don\'t say a word.\r\nI only wish you could choose too. I shall send\r\ntwenty yards.\nNow for Bath. Poor F. Cage has suffered a\r\ngood deal from her accident. The noise of the\r\nWhite Hart was terrible to her. They will keep\r\nher quiet, I dare say. She is not so much delighted\r\nwith the place as the rest of the party; probably,\r\nas she says herself, from having been less well, but\r\nshe thinks she should like it better in the season.\r\nThe streets are very empty now, and the shops not\r\nso gay as she expected. They are at No. 1 Henrietta\r\nStreet, the corner of Laura Place, and have\r\nno acquaintance at present but the Bramstons.\nLady Bridges drinks at the Cross Bath, her son\r\nat the Hot, and Louisa is going to bathe. Dr. Parry\r\nseems to be half starving Mr. Bridges, for he is restricted\r\nto much such a diet as James\'s, bread, water\r\nand meat, and is never to eat so much of that as\r\nhe wishes, and he is to walk a great deal,\xe2\x80\x94walk till\r\nhe drops, I believe,\xe2\x80\x94gout or no gout. It really is\r\nto that purpose. I have not exaggerated.\nCharming weather for you and us, and the travellers,\r\nand everybody. You will take your walk\r\nthis afternoon, and\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\nThank you, my dearest Cassandra, for the nice\r\nlong letter I sent off this morning. I hope you\r\nhave had it by this time, and that it has found you\r\nall well, and my mother no more in need of\r\nleeches. Whether this will be delivered to you by\r\nHenry on Saturday evening, or by the postman\r\non Sunday morning, I know not, as he has lately\r\nrecollected something of an engagement for Saturday,\r\nwhich perhaps may delay his visit. He seems\r\ndetermined to come to you soon, however.\nI hope you will receive the gown to-morrow,\r\nand may be able with tolerable honesty to say that\r\nyou like the color. It was bought at Grafton\r\nHouse, where, by going very early, we got immediate\r\nattendance and went on very comfortably.\r\nI only forgot the one particular thing which I had\r\nalways resolved to buy there,\xe2\x80\x94a white silk\r\nhandkerchief,\xe2\x80\x94and was therefore obliged to give six\r\nshillings for one at Crook and Besford\'s; which\r\nreminds me to say that the worsteds ought also to\r\nbe at Chawton to-morrow, and that I shall be very\r\nhappy to hear they are approved. I had not much\r\ntime for deliberation.\nWe are now all four of us young ladies sitting\r\nround the circular table in the inner room writing\r\nour letters, while the two brothers are having a\r\ncomfortable coze in the room adjoining. It is to\r\nbe a quiet evening, much to the satisfaction of four\r\nof the six. My eyes are quite tired of dust and\r\nlamps.\nThe letter you forwarded from Edward, junr.,\r\nhas been duly received. He has been shooting\r\nmost prosperously at home, and dining at Chilham\r\nCastle and with Mr. Scudamore.\nMy cap is come home, and I like it very much.\r\nFanny has one also; hers is white sarsenet and lace,\r\nof a different shape from mine, more fit for morning\r\ncarriage wear, which is what it is intended\r\nfor, and is in shape exceedingly like our own\r\nsatin and lace of last winter; shaped round the\r\nface exactly like it, with pipes and more fulness,\r\nand a round crown inserted behind. My cap has\r\na peak in front. Large full bows of very narrow\r\nribbon (old twopenny) are the thing. One over\r\nthe right temple, perhaps, and another at the left\r\near.\nHenry is not quite well. His stomach is rather\r\nderanged. You must keep him in rhubarb, and\r\ngive him plenty of port and water. He caught his\r\ncold farther back than I told you,\xe2\x80\x94before he got\r\nto Matlock, somewhere in his journey from the\r\nNorth; but the ill effects of that I hope are nearly\r\ngone.\nWe returned from Grafton House only just in\r\ntime for breakfast, and had scarcely finished breakfast\r\nwhen the carriage came to the door. From\r\neleven to half-past three we were hard at it; we did\r\ncontrive to get to Hans Place for ten minutes.\r\nMrs. T. was as affectionate and pleasing as ever.\nAfter our return Mr. Tilson walked up from\r\nthe Compting House and called upon us, and these\r\nhave been all our visitings.\nI have rejoiced more than once that I bought\r\nmy writing-paper in the country; we have not had\r\na quarter of an hour to spare.\nI enclose the eighteen-pence due to my mother.\r\nThe rose color was 6s. and the other 4s. per yard.\r\nThere was but two yards and a quarter of the dark\r\nslate in the shop, but the man promised to match\r\nit and send it off correctly.\nFanny bought her Irish at Newton\'s in Leicester\r\nSquare, and I took the opportunity of thinking\r\nabout your Irish, and seeing one piece of the yard\r\nwide at 4s., and it seemed to me very good; good\r\nenough for your purpose. It might at least be\r\nworth your while to go there, if you have no other\r\nengagements. Fanny is very much pleased with\r\nthe stockings she has bought of Remmington, silk\r\nat 12s., cotton at 4s. 3d. She thinks them great\r\nbargains, but I have not seen them yet, as my\r\nhair was dressing when the man and the stockings\r\ncame.\nThe poor girls and their teeth! I have not\r\nmentioned them yet, but we were a whole hour at\r\nSpence\'s, and Lizzy\'s were filed and lamented over\r\nagain, and poor Marianne had two taken out after\r\nall, the two just beyond the eye teeth, to make\r\nroom for those in front. When her doom was\r\nfixed, Fanny, Lizzy, and I walked into the next\r\nroom, where we heard each of the two sharp and\r\nhasty screams.\nThe little girls\' teeth I can suppose in a critical\r\nstate, but I think he must be a lover of teeth and\r\nmoney and mischief, to parade about Fanny\'s. I\r\nwould not have had him look at mine for a shilling\r\na tooth and double it. It was a disagreeable\r\nhour.\nWe then went to Wedgwood\'s, where my\r\nbrother and Fanny chose a dinner-set. I believe\r\nthe pattern is a small lozenge in purple, between\r\nlines of narrow gold, and it is to have the crest.\nWe must have been three-quarters of an hour\r\nat Grafton House, Edward sitting by all the time\r\nwith wonderful patience. There Fanny bought\r\nthe net for Anna\'s gown, and a beautiful square\r\nveil for herself. The edging there is very cheap.\r\nI was tempted by some, and I bought some very\r\nnice plaiting lace at 3s. 4d.\nFanny desires me to tell Martha, with her kind\r\nlove, that Birchall assured her there was no second\r\nset of Hook\'s Lessons for Beginners, and that, by\r\nmy advice, she has therefore chosen her a set by\r\nanother composer. I thought she would rather\r\nhave something than not. It costs six shillings.\nWith love to you all, including Triggs, I\r\nremain,\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Thank you five\r\nhundred and forty times for the exquisite piece of\r\nworkmanship which was brought into the room\r\nthis morning, while we were at breakfast, with\r\nsome very inferior works of art in the same way,\r\nand which I read with high glee, much delighted\r\nwith everything it told, whether good or bad. It\r\nis so rich in striking intelligence that I hardly\r\nknow what to reply to first. I believe finery must\r\nhave it.\nI am extremely glad that you like the poplin.\r\nI thought it would have my mother\'s approbation,\r\nbut was not so confident of yours. Remember\r\nthat it is a present. Do not refuse me. I am\r\nvery rich.\nMrs. Clement is very welcome to her little boy,\r\nand to my congratulations into the bargain, if ever\r\nyou think of giving them. I hope she will do\r\nwell. Her sister in Lucina, Mrs. H. Gipps, does\r\ntoo well, we think. Mary P. wrote on Sunday\r\nthat she had been three days on the sofa. Sackree\r\ndoes not approve it.\nWell, there is some comfort in the Mrs. Hulbart\'s\r\nnot coming to you, and I am happy to hear\r\nof the honey. I was thinking of it the other day.\r\nLet me know when you begin the new tea and\r\nthe new white wine. My present elegances have\r\nnot yet made me indifferent to such matters. I\r\nam still a cat if I see a mouse.\nI am glad you like our caps, but Fanny is out\r\nof conceit with hers already; she finds that she\r\nhas been buying a new cap without having a new\r\npattern, which is true enough. She is rather out\r\nof luck to like neither her gown nor her cap, but\r\nI do not much mind it, because besides that I like\r\nthem both myself, I consider it as a thing of course\r\nat her time of life,\xe2\x80\x94one of the sweet taxes of\r\nyouth to choose in a hurry and make bad bargains.\nI wrote to Charles yesterday, and Fanny has\r\nhad a letter from him to-day, principally to make\r\ninquiries about the time of their visit here, to\r\nwhich mine was an answer beforehand; so he will\r\nprobably write again soon to fix his week. I am\r\nbest pleased that Cassy does not go to you.\nNow, what have we been doing since I wrote\r\nlast? The Mr. K.\'s came a little before dinner\r\non Monday, and Edward went to the church with\r\nthe two seniors, but there is no inscription yet\r\ndrawn up. They are very good-natured, you know,\r\nand civil, and all that, but are not particularly\r\nsuperfine; however, they ate their dinner and\r\ndrank their tea, and went away, leaving their\r\nlovely Wadham in our arms, and I wish you had\r\nseen Fanny and me running backwards and forwards\r\nwith his breeches from the little chintz to\r\nthe white room before we went to bed, in the\r\ngreatest of frights lest he should come upon us\r\nbefore we had done it all. There had been a mistake\r\nin the housemaid\'s preparation, and they\r\nwere gone to bed.\nHe seems a very harmless sort of young man,\r\nnothing to like or dislike in him,\xe2\x80\x94goes out shooting\r\nor hunting with the two others all the morning,\r\nand plays at whist and makes queer faces in\r\nthe evening....\n[My dearest Aunt Cass.,\xe2\x80\x94I have just asked\r\nAunt Jane to let me write a little in her letter,\r\nbut she does not like it, so I won\'t. Good-by!]\nYou will have Edward\'s letter to-morrow. He\r\ntells me that he did not send you any news to interfere\r\nwith mine, but I do not think there is much\r\nfor anybody to send at present.\n\nWe had our dinner-party on Wednesday, with\r\nthe addition of Mrs. and Miss Milles, who were\r\nunder a promise of dining here in their return from\r\nEastwell, whenever they paid their visit of duty\r\nthere, and it happened to be paid on that day. Both\r\nmother and daughter are much as I have always\r\nfound them. I like the mother\xe2\x80\x94first, because she\r\nreminds me of Mrs. Birch; and, secondly, because\r\nshe is cheerful and grateful for what she is at the\r\nage of ninety and upwards. The day was pleasant\r\nenough. I sat by Mr. Chisholme, and we talked\r\naway at a great rate about nothing worth hearing.\nIt was a mistake as to the day of the Sherers\r\ngoing being fixed; they are ready, but are waiting\r\nfor Mr. Paget\'s answer.\nI inquired of Mrs. Milles after Jemima Brydges,\r\nand was quite grieved to hear that she was obliged\r\nto leave Canterbury some months ago on account\r\nof her debts, and is nobody knows where. What\r\nan unprosperous family!\nOn Saturday, soon after breakfast, Mr. J. P. left\r\nus for Norton Court. I like him very much. He\r\ngives me the idea of a very amiable young man,\r\nonly too diffident to be so agreeable as he might\r\nbe. He was out the chief of each morning with\r\nthe other two, shooting and getting wet through.\r\nTo-morrow we are to know whether he and a hundred\r\nyoung ladies will come here for the ball. I\r\ndo not much expect any.\n\nThe Deedes cannot meet us; they have engagements\r\nat home. I will finish the Deedes by saying\r\nthat they are not likely to come here till quite late\r\nin my stay,\xe2\x80\x94the very last week perhaps; and\r\nI do not expect to see the Moores at all. They\r\nare not solicited till after Edward\'s return from\r\nHampshire.\nMonday, November 15, is the day now fixed for\r\nour setting out.\nPoor Basingstoke races! There seem to have\r\nbeen two particularly wretched days on purpose\r\nfor them; and Weyhill week does not begin much\r\nhappier.\nWe were quite surprised by a letter from Anna\r\nat Tollard Royal, last Saturday; but perfectly approve\r\nher going, and only regret they should all\r\ngo so far to stay so few days.\nWe had thunder and lightning here on Thursday\r\nmorning, between five and seven; no very bad\r\nthunder, but a great deal of lightning. It has\r\ngiven the commencement of a season of wind and\r\nrain, and perhaps for the next six weeks we shall\r\nnot have two dry days together.\nLizzy is very much obliged to you for your letter\r\nand will answer it soon, but has so many things\r\nto do that it may be four or five days before she\r\ncan. This is quite her own message, spoken in\r\nrather a desponding tone. Your letter gave pleasure\r\nto all of us; we had all the reading of it of\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x94I three times, as I undertook, to the great\r\nrelief of Lizzy, to read it to Sackree, and afterwards\r\nto Louisa.\nSackree does not at all approve of Mary Doe\r\nand her nuts,\xe2\x80\x94on the score of propriety rather\r\nthan health. She saw some signs of going after\r\nher in George and Henry, and thinks if you could\r\ngive the girl a check, by rather reproving her for\r\ntaking anything seriously about nuts which they\r\nsaid to her, it might be of use. This, of course,\r\nis between our three discreet selves, a scene of\r\ntriennial bliss.\nMrs. Breton called here on Saturday. I never\r\nsaw her before. She is a large, ungenteel woman,\r\nwith self-satisfied and would-be elegant manners.\nWe are certain of some visitors to-morrow. Edward\r\nBridges comes for two nights in his way from\r\nLenham to Ramsgate, and brings a friend\xe2\x80\x94name\r\nunknown\xe2\x80\x94but supposed to be a Mr. Harpur, a\r\nneighboring clergyman; and Mr. R. Mascall is to\r\nshoot with the young men, which it is to be supposed\r\nwill end in his staying dinner.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Lushington, M.P. for Canterbury,\r\nand manager of the Lodge Hounds, dines\r\nhere, and stays the night. He is chiefly young\r\nEdward\'s acquaintance. If I can I will get a frank\r\nfrom him, and write to you all the sooner. I suppose\r\nthe Ashford ball will furnish something.\nAs I wrote of my nephews with a little bitterness\r\nin my last, I think it particularly incumbent\r\non me to do them justice now, and I have great\r\npleasure in saying that they were both at the Sacrament\r\nyesterday. After having much praised or\r\nmuch blamed anybody, one is generally sensible\r\nof something just the reverse soon afterwards.\r\nNow these two boys who are out with the foxhounds\r\nwill come home and disgust me again by some\r\nhabit of luxury or some proof of sporting mania,\r\nunless I keep it off by this prediction. They\r\namuse themselves very comfortably in the evening\r\nby netting; they are each about a rabbit net, and\r\nsit as deedily to it, side by side, as any two Uncle\r\nFranks could do.\nI am looking over "Self-Control" again, and\r\nmy opinion is confirmed of its being an excellently\r\nmeant, elegantly written work, without anything\r\nof nature or probability in it. I declare I do not\r\nknow whether Laura\'s passage down the American\r\nriver is not the most natural, possible, every-day\r\nthing she ever does.\nTuesday.\xe2\x80\x94Dear me! what is to become of me?\r\nSuch a long letter! Two-and-forty lines in the\r\nsecond page. Like Harriot Byron, I ask, what am\r\nI to do with my gratitude? I can do nothing but\r\nthank you and go on. A few of your inquiries, I\r\nthink, are replied to en avance.\nThe name of F. Cage\'s drawing-master is O\'Neil.\r\nWe are exceedingly amused with your Shalden\r\nnews, and your self-reproach on the subject of Mrs.\r\nStockwell made me laugh heartily. I rather wondered\r\nthat Johncock, the only person in the room,\r\ncould help laughing too. I had not heard before\r\nof her having the measles. Mrs. H. and Alethea\'s\r\nstaying till Friday was quite new to me; a good\r\nplan, however. I could not have settled it better\r\nmyself, and am glad they found so much in the\r\nhouse to approve, and I hope they will ask Martha\r\nto visit them. I admire the sagacity and taste of\r\nCharlotte Williams. Those large dark eyes always\r\njudge well. I will compliment her by naming a\r\nheroine after her.\nEdward has had all the particulars of the building,\r\netc., read to him twice over, and seems very\r\nwell satisfied. A narrow door to the pantry is the\r\nonly subject of solicitude; it is certainly just the\r\ndoor which should not be narrow, on account of\r\nthe trays; but if a case of necessity, it must be\r\nborne.\nI knew there was sugar in the tin, but had no\r\nidea of there being enough to last through your\r\ncompany. All the better. You ought not to think\r\nthis new loaf better than the other, because that\r\nwas the first of five which all came together.\r\nSomething of fancy, perhaps, and something of\r\nimagination.\nDear Mrs. Digweed! I cannot bear that she\r\nshould not be foolishly happy after a ball. I hope\r\nMiss Yates and her companions were all well the\r\nday after their arrival. I am thoroughly rejoiced\r\nthat Miss Benn has placed herself in lodgings,\r\nthough I hope they may not be long necessary.\nNo letter from Charles yet.\nSouthey\'s "Life of Nelson." I am tired of\r\n"Lives of Nelson," being that I never read any. I\r\nwill read this, however, if Frank is mentioned in it.\nHere am I in Kent, with one brother in the\r\nsame county and another brother\'s wife, and see\r\nnothing of them, which seems unnatural. It will\r\nnot last so forever, I trust. I should like to have\r\nMrs. F. A. and her children here for a week, but\r\nnot a syllable of that nature is ever breathed. I\r\nwish her last visit had not been so long a one.\nI wonder whether Mrs. Tilson has ever lain-in.\r\nMention it if it ever comes to your knowledge, and\r\nwe shall hear of it by the same post from Henry.\nMr. Rob. Mascall breakfasted here; he eats a\r\ngreat deal of butter. I dined upon goose yesterday,\r\nwhich, I hope, will secure a good sale of my\r\nsecond edition. Have you any tomatas? Fanny\r\nand I regale on them every day.\nDisastrous letters from the Plumptres and Oxendens.\r\nRefusals everywhere\xe2\x80\x94a blank partout\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit is not quite certain whether we go or\r\nnot; something may depend upon the disposition\r\nof Uncle Edward when he comes, and upon what\r\nwe hear at Chilham Castle this morning, for we\r\nare going to pay visits. We are going to each\r\nhouse at Chilham and to Mystole. I shall like\r\nseeing the Faggs. I shall like it all, except that\r\nwe are to set out so early that I have not time to\r\nwrite as I would wish.\nEdwd. Bridges\'s friend is a Mr. Hawker, I find,\r\nnot Harpur. I would not have you sleep in such\r\nan error for the world.\nMy brother desires his best love and thanks for\r\nall your information. He hopes the roots of the\r\nold beech have been dug away enough to allow a\r\nproper covering of mould and turf. He is sorry\r\nfor the necessity of building the new coin, but\r\nhopes they will contrive that the doorway should\r\nbe of the usual width,\xe2\x80\x94if it must be contracted\r\non one side, by widening it on the other. The appearance\r\nneed not signify. And he desires me to\r\nsay that your being at Chawton when he is will be\r\nquite necessary. You cannot think it more indispensable\r\nthan he does. He is very much obliged\r\nto you for your attention to everything. Have you\r\nany idea of returning with him to Henrietta Street\r\nand finishing your visit then? Tell me your sweet\r\nlittle innocent ideas.\nEverything of love and kindness, proper and\r\nimproper, must now suffice.\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Now I will prepare\r\nfor Mr. Lushington, and as it will be wisest also\r\nto prepare for his not coming, or my not getting a\r\nfrank, I shall write very close from the first, and\r\neven leave room for the seal in the proper place.\r\nWhen I have followed up my last with this I shall\r\nfeel somewhat less unworthy of you than the state\r\nof our correspondence now requires.\nI left off in a great hurry to prepare for our\r\nmorning visits. Of course was ready a good deal\r\nthe first, and need not have hurried so much.\r\nFanny wore her new gown and cap. I was surprised\r\nto find Mystole so pretty.\nThe ladies were at home. I was in luck, and\r\nsaw Lady Fagg and all her five daughters, with an\r\nold Mrs. Hamilton, from Canterbury, and Mrs.\r\nand Miss Chapman, from Margate, into the bargain.\r\nI never saw so plain a family,\xe2\x80\x94five sisters\r\nso very plain! They are as plain as the Foresters,\r\nor the Franfraddops, or the Seagraves, or the\r\nRivers, excluding Sophy. Miss Sally Fagg has a\r\npretty figure, and that comprises all the good looks\r\nof the family.\nIt was stupidish; Fanny did her part very well,\r\nbut there was a lack of talk altogether, and the\r\nthree friends in the house only sat by and looked\r\nat us. However, Miss Chapman\'s name is Laura,\r\nand she had a double flounce to her gown. You\r\nreally must get some flounces. Are not some of\r\nyour large stock of white morning gowns just in a\r\nhappy state for a flounce\xe2\x80\x94too short? Nobody at\r\nhome at either house in Chilham.\nEdward Bridges and his friend did not forget to\r\narrive. The friend is a Mr. Wigram, one of the\r\nthree-and-twenty children of a great rich mercantile,\r\nSir Robert Wigram, an old acquaintance of\r\nthe Footes, but very recently known to Edward B.\r\nThe history of his coming here is, that, intending\r\nto go from Ramsgate to Brighton, Edw. B. persuaded\r\nhim to take Lenham on his way, which gave\r\nhim the convenience of Mr. W.\'s gig, and the\r\ncomfort of not being alone there; but, probably\r\nthinking a few days of Gm. would be the cheapest\r\nand pleasantest way of entertaining his friend and\r\nhimself, offered a visit here, and here they stay\r\ntill to-morrow.\nMr. W. is about five or six-and-twenty, not ill-looking,\r\nand not agreeable. He is certainly no\r\naddition. A sort of cool, gentlemanlike manner,\r\nbut very silent. They say his name is Henry, a\r\nproof how unequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed.\r\nI have seen many a John and Thomas\r\nmuch more agreeable.\nWe have got rid of Mr. R. Mascall, however. I\r\ndid not like him, either. He talks too much, and\r\nis conceited, besides having a vulgarly shaped\r\nmouth. He slept here on Tuesday, so that yesterday\r\nFanny and I sat down to breakfast with six\r\ngentlemen to admire us.\nWe did not go to the ball. It was left to her to\r\ndecide, and at last she determined against it. She\r\nknew that it would be a sacrifice on the part of her\r\nfather and brothers if they went, and I hope it\r\nwill prove that she has not sacrificed much. It is\r\nnot likely that there should have been anybody\r\nthere whom she would care for. I was very glad\r\nto be spared the trouble of dressing and going, and\r\nbeing weary before it was half over; so my gown\r\nand my cap are still unworn. It will appear at\r\nlast, perhaps, that I might have done without\r\neither. I produced my brown bombazine yesterday,\r\nand it was very much admired indeed, and I\r\nlike it better than ever.\nYou have given many particulars of the state of\r\nChawton House, but still we want more. Edward\r\nwants to be expressly told that all the round tower,\r\netc., is entirely down, and the door from the best\r\nroom stopped up; he does not know enough of the\r\nappearance of things in that quarter.\nHe heard from Bath yesterday. Lady B. continues\r\nvery well, and Dr. Parry\'s opinion is, that\r\nwhile the water agrees with her she ought to remain\r\nthere, which throws their coming away at a\r\ngreater uncertainty than we had supposed. It will\r\nend, perhaps, in a fit of the gout, which may prevent\r\nher coming away. Louisa thinks her mother\'s\r\nbeing so well may be quite as much owing to her\r\nbeing so much out of doors as to the water. Lady\r\nB. is going to try the hot pump, the Cross bath\r\nbeing about to be painted. Louisa is particularly\r\nwell herself, and thinks the water has been of use\r\nto her. She mentioned our inquiries, etc., to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Alex. Evelyn, and had their best compliments\r\nand thanks to give in return. Dr. Parry\r\ndoes not expect Mr. E. to last much longer.\nOnly think of Mrs. Holder\'s being dead! Poor\r\nwoman, she has done the only thing in the world\r\nshe could possibly do to make one cease to abuse\r\nher. Now, if you please, Hooper must have it in\r\nhis power to do more by his uncle. Lucky for the\r\nlittle girl. An Anne Ekins can hardly be so unfit\r\nfor the care of a child as a Mrs. Holder.\nA letter from Wrotham yesterday offering an\r\nearly visit here, and Mr. and Mrs. Moore and one\r\nchild are to come on Monday for ten days. I hope\r\nCharles and Fanny may not fix the same time, but\r\nif they come at all in October they must. What\r\nis the use of hoping? The two parties of children\r\nis the chief evil.\nTo be sure, here we are; the very thing has\r\nhappened, or rather worse,\xe2\x80\x94a letter from Charles\r\nthis very morning, which gives us reason to suppose\r\nthey may come here to-day. It depends upon\r\nthe weather, and the weather now is very fine.\r\nNo difficulties are made, however, and, indeed,\r\nthere will be no want of room; but I wish there\r\nwere no Wigrams and Lushingtons in the way to\r\nfill up the table and make us such a motley set. I\r\ncannot spare Mr. Lushington either, because of his\r\nfrank, but Mr. Wigram does no good to anybody.\r\nI cannot imagine how a man can have the impudence\r\nto come into a family party for three days,\r\nwhere he is quite a stranger, unless he knows himself\r\nto be agreeable on undoubted authority. He\r\nand Edw. B. are going to ride to Eastwell, and as\r\nthe boys are hunting, and my brother is gone to\r\nCanty., Fanny and I have a quiet morning before\r\nus.\nEdward has driven off poor Mrs. Salkeld. It\r\nwas thought a good opportunity of doing something\r\ntowards clearing the house. By her own\r\ndesire Mrs. Fanny is to be put in the room next\r\nthe nursery, her baby in a little bed by her; and\r\nas Cassy is to have the closet within, and Betsey\r\nWilliam\'s little hole, they will be all very snug\r\ntogether. I shall be most happy to see dear\r\nCharles, and he will be as happy as he can with\r\na cross child, or some such care, pressing on him\r\nat the time. I should be very happy in the idea\r\nof seeing little Cassy again, too, did not I fear\r\nshe would disappoint me by some immediate\r\ndisagreeableness....\nThe comfort of the billiard-table here is very\r\ngreat; it draws all the gentlemen to it whenever\r\nthey are within, especially after dinner, so that my\r\nbrother, Fanny, and I have the library to ourselves\r\nin delightful quiet. There is no truth in the report\r\nof G. Hatton being to marry Miss Wemyss.\r\nHe desires it may be contradicted.\nHave you done anything about our present to\r\nMiss Benn? I suppose she must have a bed at my\r\nmother\'s whenever she dines there. How will they\r\nmanage as to inviting her when you are gone? and\r\nif they invite, how will they continue to entertain\r\nher?\nLet me know as many of your parting arrangements\r\nas you can, as to wine, etc. I wonder\r\nwhether the ink-bottle has been filled. Does\r\nbutcher\'s meat keep up at the same price, and\r\nis not bread lower than 2s. 6d.? Mary\'s blue\r\ngown! My mother must be in agonies. I have\r\na great mind to have my blue gown dyed some\r\ntime or other. I proposed it once to you, and\r\nyou made some objection, I forget what. It\r\nis the fashion of flounces that gives it particular\r\nexpediency.\nMrs. and Miss Wildman have just been here.\r\nMiss is very plain. I wish Lady B. may be returned\r\nbefore we leave Gm., that Fanny may\r\nspend the time of her father\'s absence at Goodnestone,\r\nwhich is what she would prefer.\nFriday.\xe2\x80\x94They came last night at about seven.\r\nWe had given them up, but I still expected them\r\nto come. Dessert was nearly over; a better time\r\nfor arriving than an hour and a half earlier. They\r\nwere late because they did not set out earlier, and\r\ndid not allow time enough. Charles did not aim\r\nat more than reaching Sittingbourne by three,\r\nwhich could not have brought them here by dinner-time.\r\nThey had a very rough passage; he would\r\nnot have ventured if he had known how bad it\r\nwould be.\nHowever, here they are, safe and well, just like\r\ntheir own nice selves, Fanny looking as neat and\r\nwhite this morning as possible, and dear Charles\r\nall affectionate, placid, quiet, cheerful good-humor.\r\nThey are both looking very well, but poor little\r\nCassy is grown extremely thin, and looks poorly.\r\nI hope a week\'s country air and exercise may do\r\nher good. I am sorry to say it can be but a week.\r\nThe baby does not appear so large in proportion as\r\nshe was, nor quite so pretty, but I have seen very\r\nlittle of her. Cassy was too tired and bewildered\r\njust at first to seem to know anybody. We met\r\nthem in the hall\xe2\x80\x94the women and girl part of us\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nbefore we reached the library she kissed me\r\nvery affectionately, and has since seemed to recollect\r\nme in the same way.\n\nIt was quite an evening of confusion, as you\r\nmay suppose. At first we were all walking about\r\nfrom one part of the house to the other; then came\r\na fresh dinner in the breakfast-room for Charles\r\nand his wife, which Fanny and I attended; then\r\nwe moved into the library, were joined by the\r\ndining-room people, were introduced, and so forth;\r\nand then we had tea and coffee, which was not over\r\ntill past ten. Billiards again drew all the odd\r\nones away; and Edward, Charles, the two Fannies,\r\nand I sat snugly talking. I shall be glad to have\r\nour numbers a little reduced, and by the time you\r\nreceive this we shall be only a family, though a\r\nlarge family, party. Mr. Lushington goes to-morrow.\nNow I must speak of him, and I like him very\r\nmuch. I am sure he is clever, and a man of taste.\r\nHe got a volume of Milton last night, and spoke\r\nof it with warmth. He is quite an M. P., very\r\nsmiling, with an exceeding good address and readiness\r\nof language. I am rather in love with him.\r\nI dare say he is ambitious and insincere. He puts\r\nme in mind of Mr. Dundas. He has a wide smiling\r\nmouth, and very good teeth, and something the\r\nsame complexion and nose. He is a much shorter\r\nman, with Martha\'s leave. Does Martha never\r\nhear from Mrs. Craven? Is Mrs. Craven never at\r\nhome?\nWe breakfasted in the dining-room to-day, and\r\nare now all pretty well dispersed and quiet.\r\nCharles and George are gone out shooting together,\r\nto Winnigates and Seaton Wood. I asked on purpose\r\nto tell Henry. Mr. Lushington and Edwd.\r\nare gone some other way. I wish Charles may kill\r\nsomething; but this high wind is against their\r\nsport.\nLady Williams is living at the Rose at Sittingbourne;\r\nthey called upon her yesterday; she cannot\r\nlive at Sheerness, and as soon as she gets to\r\nSittingbourne is quite well. In return for all your\r\nmatches, I announce that her brother William is\r\ngoing to marry a Miss Austen, of a Wiltshire\r\nfamily, who say they are related to us.\nI talk to Cassy about Chawton; she remembers\r\nmuch, but does not volunteer on the subject.\r\nPoor little love! I wish she were not so very\r\nPalmery, but it seems stronger than ever. I never\r\nknew a wife\'s family features have such undue\r\ninfluence.\nPapa and mamma have not yet made up their\r\nmind as to parting with her or not; the chief, indeed\r\nthe only, difficulty with mamma is a very\r\nreasonable one, the child\'s being very unwilling to\r\nleave them. When it was mentioned to her she\r\ndid not like the idea of it at all. At the same\r\ntime she has been suffering so much lately from\r\nsea-sickness that her mamma cannot bear to have\r\nher much on board this winter. Charles is less\r\ninclined to part with her. I do not know how it\r\nwill end, or what is to determine it. He desires\r\nhis best love to you, and has not written because\r\nhe has not been able to decide. They are both\r\nvery sensible of your kindness on the occasion.\nI have made Charles furnish me with something\r\nto say about young Kendall. He is going on very\r\nwell. When he first joined the "Namur," my\r\nbrother did not find him forward enough to be\r\nwhat they call put in the office, and therefore\r\nplaced him under the schoolmaster; but he is\r\nvery much improved, and goes into the office\r\nnow every afternoon, still attending school in\r\nthe morning.\nThis cold weather comes very fortunately for\r\nEdward\'s nerves, with such a house full; it suits\r\nhim exactly; he is all alive and cheerful. Poor\r\nJames, on the contrary, must be running his toes\r\ninto the fire. I find that Mary Jane Fowle was\r\nvery near returning with her brother and paying\r\nthem a visit on board. I forget exactly what hindered\r\nher; I believe the Cheltenham scheme. I\r\nam glad something did. They are to go to Cheltenham\r\non Monday se\'nnight. I don\'t vouch for\r\ntheir going, you know; it only comes from one of\r\nthe family.\nNow I think I have written you a good-sized\r\nletter, and may deserve whatever I can get in reply.\r\nInfinities of love. I must distinguish that\r\nof Fanny, senior, who particularly desires to be\r\nremembered to you all.\nMy dear Aunt Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I am very much\r\nobliged to you for your long letter and for the nice\r\naccount of Chawton. We are all very glad to hear\r\nthat the Adams are gone, and hope Dame Libscombe\r\nwill be more happy now with her deaffy child, as\r\nshe calls it, but I am afraid there is not much\r\nchance of her remaining long sole mistress of her\r\nhouse.\nI am sorry you had not any better news to send\r\nus of our hare, poor little thing! I thought it\r\nwould not live long in that Pondy House; I don\'t\r\nwonder that Mary Doe is very sorry it is dead,\r\nbecause we promised her that if it was alive when\r\nwe came back to Chawton, we would reward her for\r\nher trouble.\nPapa is much obliged to you for ordering the\r\nscrubby firs to be cut down; I think he was rather\r\nfrightened at first about the great oak. Fanny\r\nquite believed it, for she exclaimed, "Dear me,\r\nwhat a pity, how could they be so stupid!" I\r\nhope by this time they have put up some hurdles\r\nfor the sheep, or turned out the cart-horses from\r\nthe lawn.\nPray tell grandmamma that we have begun getting\r\nseeds for her; I hope we shall be able to get\r\nher a nice collection, but I am afraid this wet\r\nweather is very much against them. How glad I\r\nam to hear she has had such good success with her\r\nchickens, but I wish there had been more bantams\r\namongst them. I am very sorry to hear of poor\r\nLizzie\'s fate.\nI must now tell you something about our poor\r\npeople. I believe you know old Mary Croucher;\r\nshe gets maderer and maderer every day. Aunt\r\nJane has been to see her, but it was on one of her\r\nrational days. Poor Will Amos hopes your skewers\r\nare doing well; he has left his house in the\r\npoor Row, and lives in a barn at Builting. We\r\nasked him why he went away, and he said the fleas\r\nwere so starved when he came back from Chawton\r\nthat they all flew upon him and eenermost eat\r\nhim up.\nHow unlucky it is that the weather is so wet!\r\nPoor Uncle Charles has come home half drowned\r\nevery day.\nI don\'t think little Fanny is quite so pretty as\r\nshe was; one reason is because she wears short\r\npetticoats, I believe. I hope Cook is better; she\r\nwas very unwell the day we went away. Papa has\r\ngiven me half-a-dozen new pencils, which are very\r\ngood ones indeed; I draw every other day. I hope\r\nyou go and whip Lucy Chalcraft every night.\nMiss Clewes begs me to give her very best respects\r\nto you; she is very much obliged to you for\r\nyour kind inquiries after her. Pray give my duty\r\nto grandmamma and love to Miss Floyd. I remain,\r\nmy dear Aunt Cassandra, your very affectionate\r\nniece,\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I will keep this\r\ncelebrated birthday by writing to you; and as my\r\npen seems inclined to write large, I will put my\r\nlines very close together. I had but just time to\r\nenjoy your letter yesterday before Edward and I\r\nset off in the chair for Canty., and I allowed him\r\nto hear the chief of it as we went along.\nWe rejoice sincerely in Henry\'s gaining ground\r\nas he does, and hope there will be weather for him\r\nto get out every day this week, as the likeliest way\r\nof making him equal to what he plans for the next.\r\nIf he is tolerably well, the going into Oxfordshire\r\nwill make him better, by making him happier.\nCan it be that I have not given you the minuti\xc3\xa6\r\nof Edward\'s plans? See, here they are: To\r\ngo to Wrotham on Saturday the 13th, spend Sunday\r\nthere, and be in town on Monday to dinner,\r\nand if agreeable to Henry, spend one whole day\r\nwith him, which day is likely to be Tuesday, and\r\nso go down to Chawton on Wednesday.\nBut now I cannot be quite easy without staying\r\na little while with Henry, unless he wishes it\r\notherwise; his illness and the dull time of year\r\ntogether make me feel that it would be horrible of\r\nme not to offer to remain with him, and therefore\r\nunless you know of any objection, I wish you\r\nwould tell him with my best love that I shall be\r\nmost happy to spend ten days or a fortnight in\r\nHenrietta St., if he will accept me. I do not offer\r\nmore than a fortnight, because I shall then have\r\nbeen some time from home; but it will be a great\r\npleasure to be with him, as it always is. I have\r\nthe less regret and scruple on your account, because\r\nI shall see you for a day and a half, and because\r\nyou will have Edward for at least a week. My\r\nscheme is to take Bookham in my way home for a\r\nfew days, and my hope that Henry will be so good\r\nas to send me some part of the way thither. I\r\nhave a most kind repetition of Mrs. Cooke\'s two or\r\nthree dozen invitations, with the offer of meeting\r\nme anywhere in one of her airings.\nFanny\'s cold is much better. By dosing and\r\nkeeping her room on Sunday, she got rid of the\r\nworst of it, but I am rather afraid of what this\r\nday may do for her; she is gone to Canty. with\r\nMiss Clewes, Liz., and Marnne, and it is but roughish\r\nweather for any one in a tender state. Miss\r\nClewes has been going to Canty. ever since her\r\nreturn, and it is now just accomplishing.\nEdward and I had a delightful morning for our\r\ndrive there, I enjoyed it thoroughly; but the day\r\nturned off before we were ready, and we came home\r\nin some rain and the apprehension of a great deal.\r\nIt has not done us any harm, however. He went\r\nto inspect the gaol, as a visiting magistrate, and\r\ntook me with him. I was gratified, and went\r\nthrough all the feelings which people must go\r\nthrough, I think, in visiting such a building.\r\nWe paid no other visits, only walked about\r\nsnugly together, and shopped. I bought a concert\r\nticket and a sprig of flowers for my old age.\nTo vary the subject from gay to grave with\r\ninimitable address, I shall now tell you something\r\nof the Bath party\xe2\x80\x94and still a Bath party they\r\nare, for a fit of the gout came on last week. The\r\naccounts of Lady B. are as good as can be under\r\nsuch a circumstance; Dr. P. says it appears a\r\ngood sort of gout, and her spirits are better than\r\nusual, but as to her coming away, it is of course\r\nall uncertainty. I have very little doubt of Edward\'s\r\ngoing down to Bath, if they have not left\r\nit when he is in Hampshire; if he does, he will\r\ngo on from Steventon, and then return direct to\r\nLondon, without coming back to Chawton. This\r\ndetention does not suit his feelings. It may be\r\nrather a good thing, however, that Dr. P. should\r\nsee Lady B. with the gout on her. Harriot was\r\nquite wishing for it.\nThe day seems to improve. I wish my pen\r\nwould too.\nSweet Mr. Ogle! I dare say he sees all the\r\npanoramas for nothing, has free admittance everywhere;\r\nhe is so delightful! Now, you need not\r\nsee anybody else.\nI am glad to hear of our being likely to have a\r\npeep at Charles and Fanny at Christmas, but do\r\nnot force poor Cass. to stay if she hates it. You\r\nhave done very right as to Mrs. F. A. Your\r\ntidings of S. and S. give me pleasure. I have\r\nnever seen it advertised.\nHarriot, in a letter to Fanny to-day, inquires\r\nwhether they sell cloths for pelisses at Bedford\r\nHouse, and, if they do, will be very much obliged\r\nto you to desire them to send her down patterns,\r\nwith the width and prices; they may go from\r\nCharing Cross almost any day in the week, but\r\nif it is a ready-money house it will not do, for\r\nthe bru of feu the Archbishop says she cannot pay\r\nfor it immediately. Fanny and I suspect they do\r\nnot deal in the article.\nThe Sherers, I believe, are now really going to\r\ngo; Joseph has had a bed here the last two\r\nnights, and I do not know whether this is not the\r\nday of moving. Mrs. Sherer called yesterday to\r\ntake leave. The weather looks worse again.\nWe dine at Chilham Castle to-morrow, and I\r\nexpect to find some amusement, but more from the\r\nconcert the next day, as I am sure of seeing\r\nseveral that I want to see. We are to meet a\r\nparty from Goodnestone, Lady B., Miss Hawley,\r\nand Lucy Foote, and I am to meet Mrs. Harrison,\r\nand we are to talk about Ben and Anna. "My\r\ndear Mrs. Harrison," I shall say, "I am afraid\r\nthe young man has some of your family madness;\r\nand though there often appears to be something of\r\nmadness in Anna too, I think she inherits more\r\nof it from her mother\'s family than from ours."\r\nThat is what I shall say, and I think she will\r\nfind it difficult to answer me.\nI took up your letter again to refresh me, being\r\nsomewhat tired, and was struck with the prettiness\r\nof the hand: it is really a very pretty hand now\r\nand then,\xe2\x80\x94so small and so neat! I wish I could\r\nget as much into a sheet of paper. Another time\r\nI will take two days to make a letter in: it is\r\nfatiguing to write a whole long one at once. I\r\nhope to hear from you again on Sunday and again\r\non Friday, the day before we move. On Monday,\r\nI suppose, you will be going to Streatham, to see\r\nquiet Mr. Hill and eat very bad baker\'s bread.\nA fall in bread by the by. I hope my\r\nmother\'s bill next week will show it. I have had\r\na very comfortable letter from her, one of her\r\nfoolscap sheets quite full of little home news.\r\nAnna was there the first of the two days. An\r\nAnna sent away and an Anna fetched are different\r\nthings. This will be an excellent time for Ben\r\nto pay his visit, now that we, the formidables,\r\nare absent.\nI did not mean to eat, but Mr. Johncock has\r\nbrought in the tray, so I must. I am all alone.\r\nEdward is gone into his woods. At this present\r\ntime I have five tables, eight-and-twenty chairs,\r\nand two fires all to myself.\nMiss Clewes is to be invited to go to the concert\r\nwith us; there will be my brother\'s place and\r\nticket for her, as he cannot go. He and the other\r\nconnections of the Cages are to meet at Milgate\r\nthat very day, to consult about a proposed alteration\r\nof the Maidstone road, in which the Cages\r\nare very much interested. Sir Brook comes here\r\nin the morning, and they are to be joined by Mr.\r\nDeedes at Ashford. The loss of the concert will\r\nbe no great evil to the Squire. We shall be a\r\nparty of three ladies therefore, and to meet three\r\nladies.\n\nWhat a convenient carriage Henry\'s is, to his\r\nfriends in general! Who has it next? I am\r\nglad William\'s going is voluntary, and on no\r\nworse grounds. An inclination for the country\r\nis a venial fault. He has more of Cowper than of\r\nJohnson in him,\xe2\x80\x94fonder of tame hares and blank\r\nverse than of the full tide of human existence at\r\nCharing Cross.\nOh! I have more of such sweet flattery from\r\nMiss Sharp. She is an excellent kind friend. I\r\nam read and admired in Ireland too. There is a\r\nMrs. Fletcher, the wife of a judge, an old lady,\r\nand very good and very clever, who is all curiosity\r\nto know about me,\xe2\x80\x94what I am like, and so forth.\r\nI am not known to her by name, however. This\r\ncomes through Mrs. Carrick, not through Mrs.\r\nGore. You are quite out there.\nI do not despair of having my picture in the\r\nExhibition at last,\xe2\x80\x94all white and red, with my\r\nhead on one side; or perhaps I may marry young\r\nMr. D\'Arblay. I suppose in the mean time I\r\nshall owe dear Henry a great deal of money for\r\nprinting, etc.\nI hope Mrs. Fletcher will indulge herself with\r\nS. and S. If I am to stay in H. S., and if\r\nyou should be writing home soon, I wish you\r\nwould be so good as to give a hint of it, for I am\r\nnot likely to write there again these ten days,\r\nhaving written yesterday.\n\nFanny has set her heart upon its being a Mr.\r\nBrett who is going to marry a Miss Dora Best, of\r\nthis country. I dare say Henry has no objection.\r\nPray, where did the boys sleep?\nThe Deedes come here on Monday to stay till\r\nFriday, so that we shall end with a flourish the\r\nlast canto. They bring Isabella and one of the\r\ngrown-ups, and will come in for a Canty. ball on\r\nThursday. I shall be glad to see them. Mrs.\r\nDeedes and I must talk rationally together, I\r\nsuppose.\nEdward does not write to Henry, because of\r\nmy writing so often. God bless you. I shall be\r\nso glad to see you again, and I wish you many\r\nhappy returns of this day. Poor Lord Howard!\r\nHow he does cry about it!\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Having half an\r\nhour before breakfast (very snug, in my own\r\nroom, lovely morning, excellent fire\xe2\x80\x94fancy me!)\r\nI will give you some account of the last two days.\r\nAnd yet, what is there to be told? I shall get\r\nfoolishly minute unless I cut the matter short.\nWe met only the Bretons at Chilham Castle,\r\nbesides a Mr. and Mrs. Osborne and a Miss Lee\r\nstaying in the house, and were only fourteen altogether.\r\nMy brother and Fanny thought it the\r\npleasantest party they had ever known there, and\r\nI was very well entertained by bits and scraps. I\r\nhad long wanted to see Dr. Breton, and his wife\r\namuses me very much with her affected refinement\r\nand elegance. Miss Lee I found very conversable;\r\nshe admires Crabbe as she ought. She is at an\r\nage of reason, ten years older than myself at least.\r\nShe was at the famous ball at Chilham Castle, so\r\nof course you remember her.\nBy the by, as I must leave off being young, I\r\nfind many douceurs in being a sort of chaperon,\r\nfor I am put on the sofa near the fire, and can\r\ndrink as much wine as I like. We had music in\r\nthe evening: Fanny and Miss Wildman played,\r\nand Mr. James Wildman sat close by and listened,\r\nor pretended to listen.\nYesterday was a day of dissipation all through:\r\nfirst came Sir Brook to dissipate us before breakfast;\r\nthen there was a call from Mr. Sherer, then\r\na regular morning visit from Lady Honeywood in\r\nher way home from Eastwell; then Sir Brook\r\nand Edward set off; then we dined (five in number)\r\nat half-past four; then we had coffee; and at\r\nsix Miss Clewes, Fanny, and I drove away. We\r\nhad a beautiful night for our frisks. We were\r\nearlier than we need have been, but after a time\r\nLady B. and her two companions appeared,\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nhad kept places for them; and there we sat, all\r\nsix in a row, under a side wall, I between Lucy\r\nFoote and Miss Clewes.\nLady B. was much what I expected; I could not\r\ndetermine whether she was rather handsome or\r\nvery plain. I liked her for being in a hurry to\r\nhave the concert over and get away, and for getting\r\naway at last with a great deal of decision and\r\npromptness, not waiting to compliment and dawdle\r\nand fuss about seeing dear Fanny, who was half\r\nthe evening in another part of the room with her\r\nfriends the Plumptres. I am growing too minute,\r\nso I will go to breakfast.\nWhen the concert was over, Mrs. Harrison and\r\nI found each other out, and had a very comfortable\r\nlittle complimentary friendly chat. She is a sweet\r\nwoman,\xe2\x80\x94still quite a sweet woman in herself, and\r\nso like her sister! I could almost have thought I\r\nwas speaking to Mrs. Lefroy. She introduced me\r\nto her daughter, whom I think pretty, but most\r\ndutifully inferior to la M\xc3\xa8re Beaut\xc3\xa9. The Faggs\r\nand the Hammonds were there,\xe2\x80\x94Wm. Hammond\r\nthe only young man of renown. Miss looked very\r\nhandsome, but I prefer her little smiling flirting\r\nsister Julia.\nI was just introduced at last to Mary Plumptre,\r\nbut I should hardly know her again. She was delighted\r\nwith me, however, good enthusiastic soul!\r\nAnd Lady B. found me handsomer than she expected,\r\nso you see I am not so very bad as you\r\nmight think for.\nIt was twelve before we reached home. We were\r\nall dog-tired, but pretty well to-day: Miss Clewes\r\nsays she has not caught cold, and Fanny\'s does not\r\nseem worse. I was so tired that I began to wonder\r\nhow I should get through the ball next Thursday;\r\nbut there will be so much more variety then in\r\nwalking about, and probably so much less heat,\r\nthat perhaps I may not feel it more. My china\r\ncrape is still kept for the ball. Enough of the\r\nconcert.\nI had a letter from Mary yesterday. They travelled\r\ndown to Cheltenham last Monday very safely,\r\nand are certainly to be there a month. Bath is\r\nstill Bath. The H. Bridges must quit them early\r\nnext week, and Louisa seems not quite to despair\r\nof their all moving together, but to those who\r\nsee at a distance there appears no chance of it.\r\nDr. Parry does not want to keep Lady B. at Bath\r\nwhen she can once move. That is lucky. You\r\nwill see poor Mr. Evelyn\'s death.\nSince I wrote last, my 2nd edit. has stared me\r\nin the face. Mary tells me that Eliza means to\r\nbuy it. I wish she may. It can hardly depend\r\nupon any more Fyfield Estates. I cannot help hoping\r\nthat many will feel themselves obliged to\r\nbuy it. I shall not mind imagining it a disagreeable\r\nduty to them, so as they do it. Mary heard\r\nbefore she left home that it was very much admired\r\nat Cheltenham, and that it was given to\r\nMiss Hamilton. It is pleasant to have such a respectable\r\nwriter named. I cannot tire you, I am\r\nsure, on this subject, or I would apologize.\nWhat weather, and what news! We have\r\nenough to do to admire them both. I hope you\r\nderive your full share of enjoyment from each.\nI have extended my lights and increased my\r\nacquaintance a good deal within these two days.\r\nLady Honeywood you know; I did not sit near\r\nenough to be a perfect judge, but I thought her\r\nextremely pretty, and her manners have all the\r\nrecommendations of ease and good-humor and\r\nunaffectedness; and going about with four horses\r\nand nicely dressed herself, she is altogether a\r\nperfect sort of woman.\nOh, and I saw Mr. Gipps last night,\xe2\x80\x94the useful\r\nMr. Gipps, whose attentions came in as acceptably\r\nto us in handing us to the carriage, for want\r\nof a better man, as they did to Emma Plumptre.\r\nI thought him rather a good-looking little man.\nI long for your letter to-morrow, particularly\r\nthat I may know my fate as to London. My first\r\nwish is that Henry should really choose what he\r\nlikes best; I shall certainly not be sorry if he does\r\nnot want me. Morning church to-morrow; I\r\nshall come back with impatient feelings.\n\nThe Sherers are gone, but the Pagets are not\r\ncome: we shall therefore have Mr. S. again. Mr.\r\nPaget acts like an unsteady man. Dr. Hant,\r\nhowever, gives him a very good character; what\r\nis wrong is to be imputed to the lady. I dare say\r\nthe house likes female government.\nI have a nice long black and red letter from\r\nCharles, but not communicating much that I did\r\nnot know.\nThere is some chance of a good ball next week,\r\nas far as females go. Lady Bridges may perhaps\r\nbe there with some Knatchbulls. Mrs. Harrison\r\nperhaps, with Miss Oxenden and the Miss Papillons;\r\nand if Mrs. Harrison, then Lady Fagg will come.\nThe shades of evening are descending, and I\r\nresume my interesting narrative. Sir Brook and\r\nmy brother came back about four, and Sir Brook\r\nalmost immediately set forward again to Goodnestone.\r\nWe are to have Edwd. B. to-morrow, to\r\npay us another Sunday\'s visit,\xe2\x80\x94the last, for more\r\nreasons than one; they all come home on the same\r\nday that we go. The Deedes do not come till\r\nTuesday; Sophia is to be the comer. She is a\r\ndisputable beauty that I want much to see. Lady\r\nEliz. Hatton and Annamaria called here this\r\nmorning. Yes, they called; but I do not think\r\nI can say anything more about them. They came,\r\nand they sat, and they went.\nSunday.\xe2\x80\x94Dearest Henry! What a turn he\r\nhas for being ill, and what a thing bile is! This\r\nattack has probably been brought on in part by\r\nhis previous confinement and anxiety; but, however\r\nit came, I hope it is going fast, and that you\r\nwill be able to send a very good account of him on\r\nTuesday. As I hear on Wednesday, of course I\r\nshall not expect to hear again on Friday. Perhaps\r\na letter to Wrotham would not have an ill effect.\nWe are to be off on Saturday before the post\r\ncomes in, as Edward takes his own horses all the\r\nway. He talks of nine o\'clock. We shall bait at\r\nLenham.\nExcellent sweetness of you to send me such a\r\nnice long letter; it made its appearance, with one\r\nfrom my mother, soon after I and my impatient\r\nfeelings walked in. How glad I am that I did\r\nwhat I did! I was only afraid that you might\r\nthink the offer superfluous, but you have set my\r\nheart at ease. Tell Henry that I will stay with\r\nhim, let it be ever so disagreeable to him.\nOh, dear me! I have not time on paper for\r\nhalf that I want to say. There have been two\r\nletters from Oxford,\xe2\x80\x94one from George yesterday.\r\nThey got there very safely,\xe2\x80\x94Edwd. two hours\r\nbehind the coach, having lost his way in leaving\r\nLondon. George writes cheerfully and quietly;\r\nhopes to have Utterson\'s rooms soon; went to\r\nlecture on Wednesday, states some of his expenses,\r\nand concludes with saying, "I am afraid\r\nI shall be poor." I am glad he thinks about it so\r\nsoon. I believe there is no private tutor yet\r\nchosen, but my brother is to hear from Edwd. on\r\nthe subject shortly.\nYou, and Mrs. H., and Catherine, and Alethea\r\ngoing about together in Henry\'s carriage seeing\r\nsights\xe2\x80\x94I am not used to the idea of it yet. All\r\nthat you are to see of Streatham, seen already!\r\nYour Streatham and my Bookham may go hang.\r\nThe prospect of being taken down to Chawton by\r\nHenry perfects the plan to me. I was in hopes of\r\nyour seeing some illuminations, and you have\r\nseen them. "I thought you would come, and\r\nyou did come." I am sorry he is not to come\r\nfrom the Baltic sooner. Poor Mary!\nMy brother has a letter from Louisa to-day of\r\nan unwelcome nature; they are to spend the\r\nwinter at Bath. It was just decided on. Dr.\r\nParry wished it, not from thinking the water\r\nnecessary to Lady B., but that he might be better\r\nable to judge how far his treatment of her, which\r\nis totally different from anything she had been\r\nused to, is right; and I suppose he will not mind\r\nhaving a few more of her Ladyship\'s guineas.\r\nHis system is a lowering one. He took twelve\r\nounces of blood from her when the gout appeared,\r\nand forbids wine, etc. Hitherto the plan agrees\r\nwith her. She is very well satisfied to stay, but\r\nit is a sore disappointment to Louisa and Fanny.\nThe H. Bridges leave them on Tuesday, and\r\nthey mean to move into a smaller house; you may\r\nguess how Edward feels. There can be no doubt\r\nof his going to Bath now; I should not wonder if\r\nhe brought Fanny Cage back with him.\nYou shall hear from me once more, some day\r\nor other.\nWe had altogether a very good journey, and\r\neverything at Cobham was comfortable. I could\r\nnot pay Mr. Harrington! That was the only\r\nalas! of the business. I shall therefore return\r\nhis bill, and my mother\'s 2l., that you may try\r\nyour luck. We did not begin reading till Bentley\r\nGreen. Henry\'s approbation is hitherto even\r\nequal to my wishes. He says it is different from\r\nthe other two, but does not appear to think it\r\nat all inferior. He has only married Mrs. R. I\r\nam afraid he has gone through the most entertaining\r\npart. He took to Lady B. and Mrs. N. most\r\nkindly, and gives great praise to the drawing of\r\nthe characters. He understands them all, likes\r\nFanny, and, I think, foresees how it will all be.\r\nI finished the "Heroine" last night, and was\r\nvery much amused by it. I wonder James did\r\nnot like it better. It diverted me exceedingly.\r\nWe went to bed at ten. I was very tired, but\r\nslept to a miracle, and am lovely to-day, and at\r\npresent Henry seems to have no complaint. We\r\nleft Cobham at half-past eight, stopped to bait and\r\nbreakfast at Kingston, and were in this house\r\nconsiderably before two. Nice smiling Mr. Barlowe\r\nmet us at the door, and, in reply to inquiries\r\nafter news, said that peace was generally expected.\r\nI have taken possession of my bedroom, unpacked\r\nmy bandbox, sent Miss P.\'s two letters to the\r\ntwopenny post, been visited by Md. B., and am\r\nnow writing by myself at the new table in the\r\nfront room. It is snowing. We had some snowstorms\r\nyesterday, and a smart frost at night,\r\nwhich gave us a hard road from Cobham to Kingston;\r\nbut as it was then getting dirty and heavy,\r\nHenry had a pair of leaders put on to the bottom\r\nof Sloane St. His own horses, therefore, cannot\r\nhave had hard work. I watched for veils as we drove\r\nthrough the streets, and had the pleasure of seeing\r\nseveral upon vulgar heads. And now, how\r\ndo you all do?\xe2\x80\x94you in particular, after the worry\r\nof yesterday and the day before. I hope Martha\r\nhad a pleasant visit again, and that you and my\r\nmother could eat your beef-pudding. Depend upon\r\nmy thinking of the chimney-sweeper as soon as I\r\nwake to-morrow. Places are secured at Drury\r\nLane for Saturday, but so great is the rage for\r\nseeing Kean that only a third and fourth row\r\ncould be got; as it is in a front box, however, I\r\nhope we shall do pretty well\xe2\x80\x94Shylock, a good\r\nplay for Fanny\xe2\x80\x94she cannot be much affected, I\r\nthink. Mrs. Perigord has just been here. She\r\ntells me that we owe her master for the silk-dyeing.\r\nMy poor old muslin has never been dyed\r\nyet. It has been promised to be done several\r\ntimes. What wicked people dyers are! They\r\nbegin with dipping their own souls in scarlet\r\nsin. It is evening. We have drank tea, and I\r\nhave torn through the third vol. of the "Heroine."\r\nI do not think it falls off. It is a delightful\r\nburlesque, particularly on the Radcliffe style.\r\nHenry is going on with "Mansfield Park." He\r\nadmires H. Crawford: I mean properly, as a\r\nclever, pleasant man. I tell you all the good I\r\ncan, as I know how much you will enjoy it. We\r\nhear that Mr. Kean is more admired than ever.\r\nThere are no good places to be got in Drury Lane for\r\nthe next fortnight, but Henry means to secure\r\nsome for Saturday fortnight, when you are reckoned\r\nupon. Give my love to little Cass. I hope\r\nshe found my bed comfortable last night. I have\r\nseen nobody in London yet with such a long chin\r\nas Dr. Syntax, nor anybody quite so large as\r\nGogmagolicus.\nWell, we went to the play again last night,\r\nand as we were out a great part of the morning\r\ntoo, shopping, and seeing the Indian jugglers,\r\nI am very glad to be quiet now till dressing-time.\r\nWe are to dine at the Tilsons\', and to-morrow at\r\nMr. Spencer\'s.\nWe had not done breakfast yesterday when\r\nMr. J. Plumptre appeared to say that he had secured\r\na box. Henry asked him to dine here,\r\nwhich I fancy he was very happy to do, and so\r\nat five o\'clock we four sat down to table together,\r\nwhile the master of the house was preparing for\r\ngoing out himself. The "Farmer\'s Wife" is a\r\nmusical thing in three acts, and as Edward was\r\nsteady in not staying for anything more, we were\r\nat home before ten.\nFanny and Mr. J. P. are delighted with Miss\r\nS., and her merit in singing is, I dare say, very\r\ngreat; that she gave me no pleasure is no reflection\r\nupon her, nor, I hope, upon myself, being\r\nwhat Nature made me on that article. All that\r\nI am sensible of in Miss S. is a pleasing person\r\nand no skill in acting. We had Mathews, Liston,\r\nand Emery; of course, some amusement.\nOur friends were off before half-past eight this\r\nmorning, and had the prospect of a heavy cold\r\njourney before them. I think they both liked\r\ntheir visit very much. I am sure Fanny did.\r\nHenry sees decided attachment between her and\r\nhis new acquaintance.\nI have a cold, too, as well as my mother and\r\nMartha. Let it be a generous emulation between\r\nus which can get rid of it first.\nI wear my gauze gown to-day, long sleeves and\r\nall. I shall see how they succeed, but as yet I\r\nhave no reason to suppose long sleeves are allowable.\r\nI have lowered the bosom, especially at\r\nthe corners, and plaited black satin ribbon round\r\nthe top. Such will be my costume of vine-leaves\r\nand paste.\nPrepare for a play the very first evening, I\r\nrather think Covent Garden, to see Young in\r\n"Richard." I have answered for your little companion\'s\r\nbeing conveyed to Keppel St. immediately.\r\nI have never yet been able to get there\r\nmyself, but hope I shall soon.\nWhat cruel weather this is! and here is Lord\r\nPortsmouth married, too, to Miss Hanson.\n\nHenry has finished "Mansfield Park," and his\r\napprobation has not lessened. He found the last\r\nhalf of the last volume extremely interesting.\nI suppose my mother recollects that she gave\r\nme no money for paying Brecknell and Twining,\r\nand my funds will not supply enough.\nWe are home in such good time that I can\r\nfinish my letter to-night, which will be better\r\nthan getting up to do it to-morrow, especially as,\r\non account of my cold, which has been very heavy\r\nin my head this evening, I rather think of lying\r\nin bed later than usual. I would not but be well\r\nenough to go to Hertford St. on any account.\nWe met only Genl. Chowne to-day, who has\r\nnot much to say for himself. I was ready to\r\nlaugh at the remembrance of Frederick, and such\r\na different Frederick as we chose to fancy him to\r\nthe real Christopher!\nMrs. Tilson had long sleeves, too, and she assured\r\nme that they are worn in the evening by\r\nmany. I was glad to hear this. She dines here,\r\nI believe, next Tuesday.\nOn Friday we are to be snug with only Mr.\r\nBarlowe and an evening of business. I am so\r\npleased that the mead is brewed. Love to all.\r\nI have written to Mrs. Hill, and care for nobody.\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Fanny takes my\r\nmother to Alton this morning, which gives me an\r\nopportunity of sending you a few lines without\r\nany other trouble than that of writing them.\nThis is a delightful day in the country, and I\r\nhope not much too hot for town. Well, you had\r\na good journey, I trust, and all that, and not rain\r\nenough to spoil your bonnet. It appeared so\r\nlikely to be a wet evening that I went up to the\r\nGt. House between three and four, and dawdled\r\naway an hour very comfortably, though Edwd. was\r\nnot very brisk. The air was clearer in the evening,\r\nand he was better. We all five walked together\r\ninto the kitchen garden and along the\r\nGosport road, and they drank tea with us.\nYou will be glad to hear that G. Turner has\r\nanother situation, something in the cow line, near\r\nRumsey, and he wishes to move immediately,\r\nwhich is not likely to be inconvenient to anybody.\nThe new nurseryman at Alton comes this morning\r\nto value the crops in the garden.\nThe only letter to-day is from Mrs. Cooke to\r\nme. They do not leave home till July, and want\r\nme to come to them, according to my promise.\r\nAnd, after considering everything, I have resolved\r\non going. My companions promote it. I will not\r\ngo, however, till after Edward is gone, that he\r\nmay feel he has a somebody to give memorandums\r\nto, to the last. I must give up all help from his\r\ncarriage, of course. And, at any rate, it must be\r\nsuch an excess of expense that I have quite made\r\nup my mind to it, and do not mean to care.\nI have been thinking of Triggs and the chair,\r\nyou may be sure, but I know it will end in posting.\r\nThey will meet me at Guildford.\nIn addition to their standing claims on me they\r\nadmire "Mansfield Park" exceedingly. Mr.\r\nCooke says "it is the most sensible novel he ever\r\nread," and the manner in which I treat the clergy\r\ndelights them very much. Altogether, I must\r\ngo, and I want you to join me there when your\r\nvisit in Henrietta St. is over. Put this into your\r\ncapacious head.\nTake care of yourself, and do not be trampled\r\nto death in running after the Emperor. The report\r\nin Alton yesterday was that they would certainly\r\ntravel this road either to or from Portsmouth.\r\nI long to know what this bow of the\r\nPrince\'s will produce.\nI saw Mrs. Andrews yesterday. Mrs. Browning\r\nhad seen her before. She is very glad to send an\r\nElizabeth.\nMiss Benn continues the same. Mr. Curtis,\r\nhowever, saw her yesterday, and said her hand\r\nwas going on as well as possible. Accept our\r\nbest love.\nDearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I received your pretty\r\nletter while the children were drinking tea with us,\r\nas Mr. Louch was so obliging as to walk over\r\nwith it. Your good account of everybody made\r\nus very happy.\nI heard yesterday from Frank. When he began\r\nhis letter he hoped to be here on Monday, but\r\nbefore it was ended he had been told that the\r\nnaval review would not take place till Friday,\r\nwhich would probably occasion him some delay,\r\nas he cannot get some necessary business of his\r\nown attended to while Portsmouth is in such a\r\nbustle. I hope Fanny has seen the Emperor,\r\nand then I may fairly wish them all away. I\r\ngo to-morrow, and hope for some delays and\r\nadventures.\nMy mother\'s wood is brought in, but, by some\r\nmistake, no bavins. She must therefore buy\r\nsome.\n\nHenry at White\'s! Oh, what a Henry! I do\r\nnot know what to wish as to Miss B., so I will\r\nhold my tongue and my wishes.\nSackree and the children set off yesterday, and\r\nhave not been returned back upon us. They were\r\nall very well the evening before. We had handsome\r\npresents from the Gt. House yesterday,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nham and the four leeches. Sackree has left some\r\nshirts of her master\'s at the school, which, finished\r\nor unfinished, she begs to have sent by Henry and\r\nWm. Mr. Hinton is expected home soon, which\r\nis a good thing for the shirts.\nWe have called upon Miss Dusantoy and Miss\r\nPapillon, and been very pretty. Miss D. has a\r\ngreat idea of being Fanny Price,\xe2\x80\x94she and her\r\nyoungest sister together, who is named Fanny.\nMiss Benn has drank tea with the Prowtings,\r\nand, I believe, comes to us this evening. She has\r\nstill a swelling about the forefinger and a little\r\ndischarge, and does not seem to be on the point of\r\na perfect cure, but her spirits are good, and she\r\nwill be most happy, I believe, to accept any invitation.\r\nThe Clements are gone to Petersfield to\r\nlook.\nOnly think of the Marquis of Granby being\r\ndead. I hope, if it please Heaven there should\r\nbe another son, they will have better sponsors and\r\nless parade.\nI certainly do not wish that Henry should think\r\nagain of getting me to town. I would rather\r\nreturn straight from Bookham; but if he really\r\ndoes propose it, I cannot say No to what will be\r\nso kindly intended. It could be but for a few\r\ndays, however, as my mother would be quite disappointed\r\nby my exceeding the fortnight which I\r\nnow talk of as the outside\xe2\x80\x94at least, we could\r\nnot both remain longer away comfortably.\nThe middle of July is Martha\'s time, as far as\r\nshe has any time. She has left it to Mrs. Craven\r\nto fix the day. I wish she could get her money\r\npaid, for I fear her going at all depends upon\r\nthat.\nInstead of Bath the Deans Dundases have taken\r\na house at Clifton\xe2\x80\x94Richmond Terrace\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nis as glad of the change as even you and I should\r\nbe, or almost. She will now be able to go on\r\nfrom Berks and visit them without any fears from\r\nheat.\nThis post has brought me a letter from Miss\r\nSharpe. Poor thing! she has been suffering indeed,\r\nbut is now in a comparative state of comfort.\r\nShe is at Sir W. P.\'s, in Yorkshire, with the\r\nchildren, and there is no appearance of her quitting\r\nthem. Of course we lose the pleasure of seeing\r\nher here. She writes highly of Sir Wm. I\r\ndo so want him to marry her. There is a Dow.\r\nLady P. presiding there to make it all right.\r\nThe Man is the same; but she does not mention\r\nwhat he is by profession or trade. She does not\r\nthink Lady P. was privy to his scheme on her,\r\nbut, on being in his power, yielded. Oh, Sir\r\nWm.! Sir Wm.! how I will love you if you will\r\nlove Miss Sharpe!\nMrs. Driver, etc., are off by Collier, but so near\r\nbeing too late that she had not time to call and\r\nleave the keys herself. I have them, however. I\r\nsuppose one is the key of the linen-press, but I do\r\nnot know what to guess the other.\nThe coach was stopped at the blacksmith\'s, and\r\nthey came running down with Triggs and Browning,\r\nand trunks, and birdcages. Quite amusing.\nMy mother desires her love, and hopes to hear\r\nfrom you.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I had a very good\r\njourney, not crowded, two of the three taken up\r\nat Bentley being children, the others of a reasonable\r\nsize; and they were all very quiet and civil.\r\nWe were late in London, from being a great load,\r\nand from changing coaches at Farnham; it was\r\nnearly four, I believe, when we reached Sloane\r\nStreet. Henry himself met me, and as soon as\r\nmy trunk and basket could be routed out from all\r\nthe other trunks and baskets in the world, we\r\nwere on our way to Hans Place in the luxury of a\r\nnice, large, cool, dirty hackney coach.\nThere were four in the kitchen part of Yalden,\r\nand I was told fifteen at top, among them Percy\r\nBenn. We met in the same room at Egham, but\r\npoor Percy was not in his usual spirits. He would\r\nbe more chatty, I dare say, in his way from Woolwich.\r\nWe took up a young Gibson at Holybourn,\r\nand, in short, everybody either did come up by\r\nYalden yesterday, or wanted to come up. It put\r\nme in mind of my own coach between Edinburgh\r\nand Stirling.\nHenry is very well, and has given me an account\r\nof the Canterbury races, which seem to have been\r\nas pleasant as one could wish. Everything went\r\nwell. Fanny had good partners, Mr. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 was her\r\nsecond on Thursday, but he did not dance with\r\nher any more.\nThis will content you for the present. I must\r\njust add, however, that there were no Lady Charlottes,\r\nthey were gone off to Kirby, and that Mary\r\nOxenden, instead of dying, is going to marry Wm.\r\nHammond.\n\nNo James and Edward yet. Our evening yesterday\r\nwas perfectly quiet; we only talked a little\r\nto Mr. Tilson across the intermediate gardens; she\r\nwas gone out airing with Miss Burdett. It is a\r\ndelightful place,\xe2\x80\x94more than answers my expectation.\r\nHaving got rid of my unreasonable ideas, I\r\nfind more space and comfort in the rooms than\r\nI had supposed, and the garden is quite a love. I\r\nam in the front attic, which is the bedchamber to\r\nbe preferred.\nHenry wants you to see it all, and asked\r\nwhether you would return with him from Hampshire;\r\nI encouraged him to think you would. He\r\nbreakfasts here early, and then rides to Henrietta\r\nSt. If it continues fine, John is to drive me\r\nthere by and by, and we shall take an airing together;\r\nand I do not mean to take any other exercise,\r\nfor I feel a little tired after my long jumble.\r\nI live in his room downstairs; it is particularly\r\npleasant from opening upon the garden. I go and\r\nrefresh myself every now and then, and then come\r\nback to solitary coolness. There is one maidservant\r\nonly, a very creditable, clean-looking young\r\nwoman. Richard remains for the present.\nWednesday morning.\xe2\x80\x94My brother and Edwd.\r\narrived last night. They could not get places the\r\nday before. Their business is about teeth and\r\nwigs, and they are going after breakfast to Scarman\'s\r\nand Tavistock St., and they are to return\r\nto go with me afterwards in the barouche. I hope\r\nto do some of my errands to-day.\nI got the willow yesterday, as Henry was not\r\nquite ready when I reached Hena. St. I saw Mr.\r\nHampson there for a moment. He dines here to-morrow,\r\nand proposed bringing his son; so I must\r\nsubmit to seeing George Hampson, though I had\r\nhoped to go through life without it. It was one of\r\nmy vanities, like your not reading "Patronage."\nAfter leaving H. St. we drove to Mrs. Latouche\'s;\r\nthey are always at home, and they are\r\nto dine here on Friday. We could do no more, as\r\nit began to rain.\nWe dine at half-past four to-day, that our\r\nvisitors may go to the play, and Henry and I are\r\nto spend the evening with the Tilsons, to meet\r\nMiss Burnett, who leaves town to-morrow. Mrs.\r\nT. called on me yesterday.\nIs not this all that can have happened or been\r\narranged? Not quite. Henry wants me to see\r\nmore of his Hanwell favorite, and has written to\r\ninvite her to spend a day or two here with me.\r\nHis scheme is to fetch her on Saturday. I am\r\nmore and more convinced that he will marry again\r\nsoon, and like the idea of her better than of anybody\r\nelse at hand.\nNow I have breakfasted and have the room\r\nto myself again. It is likely to be a fine day.\r\nHow do you all do?\n\nHenry talks of being at Chawton about the\r\n1st of Sept. He has once mentioned a scheme\r\nwhich I should rather like,\xe2\x80\x94calling on the Birches\r\nand the Crutchleys in our way. It may never\r\ncome to anything, but I must provide for the\r\npossibility by troubling you to send up my silk\r\npelisse by Collier on Saturday. I feel it would be\r\nnecessary on such an occasion; and be so good as to\r\nput up a clean dressing-gown which will come from\r\nthe wash on Friday. You need not direct it to be\r\nleft anywhere. It may take its chance.\nWe are to call for Henry between three and\r\nfour, and I must finish this and carry it with me,\r\nas he is not always there in the morning before the\r\nparcel is made up. And before I set off, I must\r\nreturn Mrs. Tilson\'s visit. I hear nothing of the\r\nHoblyns, and abstain from all inquiry.\nI hope Mary Jane and Frank\'s gardens go on\r\nwell. Give my love to them all\xe2\x80\x94Nunna Hat\'s\r\nlove to George. A great many people wanted to\r\nrun up in the Poach as well as me. The wheat\r\nlooked very well all the way, and James says the\r\nsame of his road.\nThe same good account of Mrs. C.\'s health continues,\r\nand her circumstances mend. She gets\r\nfarther and farther from poverty. What a\r\ncomfort! Good-by to you.\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94I am very much obliged to\r\nyou for sending your MS. It has entertained me\r\nextremely; indeed all of us. I read it aloud to\r\nyour grandmamma and Aunt Cass, and we were all\r\nvery much pleased. The spirit does not droop at\r\nall. Sir Thos., Lady Helen, and St. Julian are\r\nvery well done, and Cecilia continues to be interesting\r\nin spite of her being so amiable. It was\r\nvery fit you should advance her age. I like the\r\nbeginning of Devereux Forester very much, a\r\ngreat deal better than if he had been very good or\r\nvery bad. A few verbal corrections are all that I\r\nfelt tempted to make; the principal of them is a\r\nspeech of St. Julian to Lady Helen, which you\r\nsee I have presumed to alter. As Lady H. is\r\nCecilia\'s superior, it would not be correct to talk of\r\nher being introduced. It is Cecilia who must be\r\nintroduced. And I do not like a lover speaking\r\nin the 3rd person; it is too much like the part of\r\nLord Overtley, and I think it not natural. If you\r\nthink differently, however, you need not mind me.\r\nI am impatient for more, and only wait for a safe\r\nconveyance to return this.\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94I am quite ashamed to find\r\nthat I have never answered some question of yours\r\nin a former note. I kept it on purpose to refer to\r\nit at a proper time, and then forgot it. I like the\r\nname "Which is the Heroine" very well, and I\r\ndare say shall grow to like it very much in time;\r\nbut "Enthusiasm" was something so very superior\r\nthat my common title must appear to disadvantage.\r\nI am not sensible of any blunders\r\nabout Dawlish; the library was pitiful and\r\nwretched twelve years ago, and not likely to have\r\nanybody\'s publications. There is no such title as\r\nDesborough, either among dukes, marquises, earls,\r\nviscounts, or barons. These were your inquiries.\r\nI will now thank you for your envelope received\r\nthis morning. Your Aunt Cass is as well pleased\r\nwith St. Julian as ever, and I am delighted with\r\nthe idea of seeing Progillian again.\nWednesday, 17.\xe2\x80\x94We have now just finished the\r\nfirst of the three books I had the pleasure of receiving\r\nyesterday. I read it aloud, and we are all\r\nvery much amused, and like the work quite as\r\nwell as ever. I depend on getting through\r\nanother book before dinner, but there is really a\r\ngood deal of respectable reading in your forty-eight\r\npages. I have no doubt six would make a very\r\ngood-sized volume. You must have been quite\r\npleased to have accomplished so much. I like\r\nLord Portman and his brother very much. I\r\nam only afraid that Lord P.\'s good nature will\r\nmake most people like him better than he deserves.\r\nThe whole family are very good; and Lady Anne,\r\nwho was your great dread, you have succeeded\r\nparticularly well with. Bell Griffin is just what\r\nshe should be. My corrections have not been\r\nmore important than before; here and there we\r\nhave thought the sense could be expressed in fewer\r\nwords, and I have scratched out Sir Thos. from\r\nwalking with the others to the stables, etc. the\r\nvery day after breaking his arm; for though I\r\nfind your papa did walk out immediately after his\r\narm was set, I think it can be so little usual as\r\nto appear unnatural in a book. Lynn will not\r\ndo. Lynn is towards forty miles from Dawlish\r\nand would not be talked of there. I have put\r\nStarcross instead. If you prefer Easton, that must\r\nbe always safe.\nI have also scratched out the introduction between\r\nLord Portman and his brother and Mr.\r\nGriffin. A country surgeon (don\'t tell Mr. C.\r\nLyford) would not be introduced to men of their\r\nrank; and when Mr. P. is first brought in, he\r\nwould not be introduced as the Honorable. That\r\ndistinction is never mentioned at such times; at\r\nleast, I believe not. Now we have finished the\r\nsecond book, or rather the fifth. I do think you\r\nhad better omit Lady Helena\'s postscript. To\r\nthose that are acquainted with "Pride and Prejudice"\r\nit will seem an imitation. And your Aunt\r\nC. and I both recommend your making a little\r\nalteration in the last scene between Devereux F.\r\nand Lady Clanmurray and her daughter. We\r\nthink they press him too much, more than sensible\r\nor well-bred women would do; Lady C., at least,\r\nshould have discretion enough to be sooner satisfied\r\nwith his determination of not going with them. I\r\nam very much pleased with Egerton as yet. I did\r\nnot expect to like him, but I do, and Susan is a\r\nvery nice little animated creature; but St. Julian\r\nis the delight of our lives. He is quite interesting.\r\nThe whole of his break-off with Lady Helena\r\nis very well done. Yes; Russell Square is a very\r\nproper distance from Berkeley Square. We are\r\nreading the last book. They must be two days\r\ngoing from Dawlish to Bath. They are nearly\r\none hundred miles apart.\nThursday.\xe2\x80\x94We finished it last night after our\r\nreturn from drinking tea at the Great House.\r\nThe last chapter does not please us quite so well;\r\nwe do not thoroughly like the play, perhaps from\r\nhaving had too much of plays in that way lately\r\n(vide "Mansfield Park"), and we think you had\r\nbetter not leave England. Let the Portmans go\r\nto Ireland; but as you know nothing of the manners\r\nthere, you had better not go with them. You\r\nwill be in danger of giving false representations.\r\nStick to Bath and the Foresters. There you will\r\nbe quite at home.\nYour Aunt C. does not like desultory novels,\r\nand is rather afraid yours will be too much so,\r\nthat there will be too frequently a change from\r\none set of people to another, and that circumstances\r\nwill be introduced of apparent consequence\r\nwhich will lead to nothing. It will not be so\r\ngreat an objection to me if it does. I allow much\r\nmore latitude than she does, and think Nature and\r\nspirit cover many sins of a wandering story, and\r\npeople in general do not care so much about it for\r\nyour comfort.\nI should like to have had more of Devereux. I\r\ndo not feel enough acquainted with him. You\r\nwere afraid of meddling with him, I dare say. I\r\nlike your sketch of Lord Clanmurray, and your\r\npicture of the two young girls\' enjoyment is\r\nvery good. I have not noticed St. Julian\'s serious\r\nconversation with Cecilia, but I like it\r\nexceedingly. What he says about the madness\r\nof otherwise sensible women on the subject of\r\ntheir daughters coming out is worth its weight\r\nin gold.\nI do not perceive that the language sinks.\r\nPray go on.\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94We have been very much\r\namused by your three books, but I have a good\r\nmany criticisms to make, more than you will like.\r\nWe are not satisfied with Mrs. Forester settling\r\nherself as tenant and near neighbor to such a man\r\nas Sir Thomas, without having some other inducement\r\nto go there. She ought to have some friend\r\nliving thereabouts to tempt her. A woman going\r\nwith two girls just growing up into a neighborhood\r\nwhere she knows nobody but one man of not very\r\ngood character, is an awkwardness which so prudent\r\na woman as Mrs. F. would not be likely to\r\nfall into. Remember she is very prudent. You\r\nmust not let her act inconsistently. Give her a\r\nfriend, and let that friend be invited by Sir\r\nThomas H. to meet her, and we shall have no\r\nobjection to her dining at the Priory as she does;\r\nbut otherwise a woman in her situation would\r\nhardly go there before she had been visited by\r\nother families. I like the scene itself, the Miss\r\nLeslie, Lady Anne, and the music very much.\r\nLeslie is a noble name. Sir Thomas H. you always\r\ndo very well. I have only taken the liberty\r\nof expunging one phrase of his which would not be\r\nallowable,\xe2\x80\x94"Bless my heart!" It is too familiar\r\nand inelegant. Your grandmother is more\r\ndisturbed at Mrs. Forester\'s not returning the\r\nEgertons\' visit sooner than by anything else.\r\nThey ought to have called at the Parsonage before\r\nSunday. You describe a sweet place, but your\r\ndescriptions are often more minute than will be\r\nliked. You give too many particulars of right\r\nhand and left. Mrs. Forester is not careful\r\nenough of Susan\'s health. Susan ought not to be\r\nwalking out so soon after heavy rains, taking long\r\nwalks in the dirt. An anxious mother would not\r\nsuffer it. I like your Susan very much; she is a\r\nsweet creature, her playfulness of fancy is very\r\ndelightful. I like her as she is now exceedingly,\r\nbut I am not quite so well satisfied with her behavior\r\nto George R. At first she seems all over\r\nattachment and feeling, and afterwards to have\r\nnone at all; she is so extremely confused at the\r\nball, and so well satisfied apparently with Mr.\r\nMorgan. She seems to have changed her character.\nYou are now collecting your people delightfully,\r\ngetting them exactly into such a spot as is\r\nthe delight of my life. Three or four families in\r\na country village is the very thing to work on,\r\nand I hope you will do a great deal more, and\r\nmake full use of them while they are so very\r\nfavorably arranged.\nYou are but now coming to the heart and\r\nbeauty of your story. Until the heroine grows\r\nup the fun must be imperfect, but I expect a great\r\ndeal of entertainment from the next three or four\r\nbooks, and I hope you will not resent these remarks\r\nby sending me no more. We like the\r\nEgertons very well. We see no blue pantaloons\r\nor cocks or hens. There is nothing to enchant\r\none certainly in Mr. L. L., but we make no objection\r\nto him, and his inclination to like Susan\r\nis pleasing. The sister is a good contrast, but\r\nthe name of Rachel is as much as I can bear.\r\nThey are not so much like the Papillons as I\r\nexpected. Your last chapter is very entertaining,\r\nthe conversation on genius, etc.; Mr. St. Julian\r\nand Susan both talk in character, and very well.\r\nIn some former parts Cecilia is perhaps a little\r\ntoo solemn and good, but upon the whole her\r\ndisposition is very well opposed to Susan\'s, her\r\nwant of imagination is very natural. I wish you\r\ncould make Mrs. Forester talk more; but she\r\nmust be difficult to manage and make entertaining,\r\nbecause there is so much good sense and\r\npropriety about her that nothing can be made very\r\nbroad. Her economy and her ambition must not\r\nbe staring. The papers left by Mrs. Fisher are\r\nvery good. Of course one guesses something. I\r\nhope when you have written a great deal more,\r\nyou will be equal to scratching out some of the\r\npast. The scene with Mrs. Mellish I should condemn;\r\nit is prosy and nothing to the purpose,\r\nand indeed the more you can find in your heart to\r\ncurtail between Dawlish and Newton Priors, the\r\nbetter I think it will be,\xe2\x80\x94one does not care for\r\ngirls until they are grown up. Your Aunt C.\r\nquite understands the exquisiteness of that name,\xe2\x80\x94Newton\r\nPriors is really a nonpareil. Milton would\r\nhave given his eyes to have thought of it. Is not\r\nthe cottage taken from Tollard Royal?\n[Thus far the letter was written on the 9th, but\r\nbefore it was finished news arrived at Chawton of\r\nthe death of Mrs. Charles Austen. She died in\r\nher confinement, and the baby died also. She\r\nleft three little girls,\xe2\x80\x94Cassie, Harriet, and\r\nFanny. It was not until the 18th that Jane\r\nresumed her letter as follows:]\nSunday.\xe2\x80\x94I am very glad, dear Anna, that I\r\nwrote as I did before this sad event occurred. I\r\nhave only to add that your grandmamma does not\r\nseem the worse now for the shock.\nI shall be very happy to receive more of your\r\nwork if more is ready; and you write so fast that\r\nI have great hopes Mr. Digweed will come back\r\nfreighted with such a cargo as not all his hops or\r\nhis sheep could equal the value of.\n\nYour grandmamma desires me to say that she\r\nwill have finished your shoes to-morrow, and\r\nthinks they will look very well. And that she\r\ndepends upon seeing you, as you promise, before\r\nyou quit the country, and hopes you will give her\r\nmore than a day.\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94I hope you do not depend on\r\nhaving your book again immediately. I kept it\r\nthat your grandmamma may hear it, for it has\r\nnot been possible yet to have any public reading.\r\nI have read it to your Aunt Cassandra, however,\r\nin our own room at night, while we undressed,\r\nand with a great deal of pleasure. We like the\r\nfirst chapter extremely, with only a little doubt\r\nwhether Lady Helena is not almost too foolish.\r\nThe matrimonial dialogue is very good certainly.\r\nI like Susan as well as ever, and begin now not\r\nto care at all about Cecilia; she may stay at\r\nEaston Court as long as she likes. Henry Mellish\r\nwill be, I am afraid, too much in the common\r\nnovel style,\xe2\x80\x94a handsome, amiable, unexceptionable\r\nyoung man (such as do not much abound in\r\nreal life), desperately in love and all in vain.\r\nBut I have no business to judge him so early\r\nJane Egerton is a very natural, comprehensible\r\ngirl, and the whole of her acquaintance with\r\nSusan and Susan\'s letter to Cecilia are very pleasing\r\nand quite in character. But Miss Egerton\r\ndoes not entirely satisfy us. She is too formal\r\nand solemn, we think, in her advice to her\r\nbrother not to fall in love; and it is hardly like a\r\nsensible woman,\xe2\x80\x94it is putting it into his head.\r\nWe should like a few hints from her better. We\r\nfeel really obliged to you for introducing a Lady\r\nKenrick; it will remove the greatest fault in the\r\nwork, and I give you credit for considerable forbearance\r\nas an author in adopting so much of our\r\nopinion. I expect high fun about Mrs. Fisher\r\nand Sir Thomas. You have been perfectly right\r\nin telling Ben. Lefroy of your work, and I am\r\nvery glad to hear how much he likes it. His\r\nencouragement and approbation must be "quite\r\nbeyond everything." I do not at all wonder at\r\nhis not expecting to like anybody so well as\r\nCecilia at first, but I shall be surprised if he does\r\nnot become a Susanite in time. Devereux Forester\'s\r\nbeing ruined by his vanity is extremely\r\ngood, but I wish you would not let him plunge\r\ninto a "vortex of dissipation." I do not object to\r\nthe thing, but I cannot bear the expression; it\r\nis such thorough novel slang, and so old that I\r\ndare say Adam met with it in the first novel he\r\nopened. Indeed, I did very much like to know\r\nBen\'s opinion. I hope he will continue to be\r\npleased with it, and I think he must, but I cannot\r\nflatter him with there being much incident.\r\nWe have no great right to wonder at his not\r\nvaluing the name of Progillian. That is a source\r\nof delight which even he can hardly be quite\r\ncompetent to.\nWalter Scott has no business to write novels,\r\nespecially good ones. It is not fair. He has fame\r\nand profit enough as a poet, and should not be taking\r\nthe bread out of the mouths of other people.\nI do not like him, and do not mean to like\r\n"Waverley" if I can help it, but fear I must.\nI am quite determined, however, not to be pleased\r\nwith Mrs. West\'s "Alicia De Lacy," should I ever\r\nmeet with it, which I hope I shall not. I think\r\nI can be stout against anything written by Mrs.\r\nWest. I have made up my mind to like no novels\r\nreally but Miss Edgeworth\'s, yours, and my own.\nWhat can you do with Egerton to increase\r\nthe interest for him? I wish you could contrive\r\nsomething, some family occurrence to bring out\r\nhis good qualities more. Some distress among\r\nbrothers and sisters to relieve by the sale of his\r\ncuracy! Something to carry him mysteriously\r\naway, and then be heard of at York or Edinburgh\r\nin an old greatcoat. I would not seriously recommend\r\nanything improbable, but if you could\r\ninvent something spirited for him, it would have\r\na good effect. He might lend all his money to\r\nCaptain Morris, but then he would be a great fool\r\nif he did. Cannot the Morrises quarrel and he\r\nreconcile them? Excuse the liberty I take in\r\nthese suggestions.\nYour Aunt Frank\'s nursemaid has just given\r\nher warning, but whether she is worth your\r\nhaving, or would take your place, I know not.\r\nShe was Mrs. Webb\'s maid before she went to the\r\nGreat House. She leaves your aunt because she\r\ncannot agree with the other servants. She is in\r\nlove with the man, and her head seems rather\r\nturned. He returns her affection, but she fancies\r\nevery one else is wanting him and envying her.\r\nHer previous service must have fitted her for such\r\na place as yours, and she is very active and\r\ncleanly. The Webbs are really gone! When I\r\nsaw the wagons at the door, and thought of all\r\nthe trouble they must have in moving, I began to\r\nreproach myself for not having liked them better;\r\nbut since the wagons have disappeared my conscience\r\nhas been closed again, and I am excessively\r\nglad they are gone.\nI am very fond of Sherlock\'s sermons, and prefer\r\nthem to almost any.\nI feel quite as doubtful as you could be, my\r\ndearest Fanny, as to when my letter may be finished,\r\nfor I can command very little quiet time at\r\npresent; but yet I must begin, for I know you will\r\nbe glad to hear as soon as possible, and I really\r\nam impatient myself to be writing something on\r\nso very interesting a subject, though I have no\r\nhope of writing anything to the purpose. I shall\r\ndo very little more, I dare say, than say over\r\nagain what you have said before.\nI was certainly a good deal surprised at first,\r\nas I had no suspicion of any change in your feelings,\r\nand I have no scruple in saying that you\r\ncannot be in love. My dear Fanny, I am ready to\r\nlaugh at the idea, and yet it is no laughing matter\r\nto have had you so mistaken as to your own\r\nfeelings. And with all my heart I wish I had\r\ncautioned you on that point when first you spoke\r\nto me; but though I did not think you then much\r\nin love, I did consider you as being attached in a\r\ndegree quite sufficiently for happiness, as I had no\r\ndoubt it would increase with opportunity, and from\r\nthe time of our being in London together I thought\r\nyou really very much in love. But you certainly\r\nare not at all\xe2\x80\x94there is no concealing it.\n\nWhat strange creatures we are! It seems as if\r\nyour being secure of him had made you indifferent.\r\nThere was a little disgust, I suspect, at the races,\r\nand I do not wonder at it. His expressions then\r\nwould not do for one who had rather more acuteness,\r\npenetration, and taste, than love, which was\r\nyour case. And yet, after all, I am surprised that\r\nthe change in your feelings should be so great.\r\nHe is just what he ever was, only more evidently\r\nand uniformly devoted to you. This is all the\r\ndifference. How shall we account for it?\nMy dearest Fanny, I am writing what will not\r\nbe of the smallest use to you. I am feeling differently\r\nevery moment, and shall not be able to suggest\r\na single thing that can assist your mind. I\r\ncould lament in one sentence and laugh in the next,\r\nbut as to opinion or counsel I am sure that none\r\nwill be extracted worth having from this letter.\nI read yours through the very evening I received\r\nit, getting away by myself. I could not\r\nbear to leave off when I had once begun. I was\r\nfull of curiosity and concern. Luckily your At.\r\nC. dined at the other house; therefore I had not\r\nto man[oe]uvre away from her, and as to anybody\r\nelse, I do not care.\nPoor dear Mr. A.! Oh, dear Fanny! your mistake\r\nhas been one that thousands of women fall\r\ninto. He was the first young man who attached\r\nhimself to you. That was the charm, and most\r\npowerful it is. Among the multitudes, however,\r\nthat make the same mistake with yourself, there\r\ncan be few indeed who have so little reason to\r\nregret it; his character and his attachment leave\r\nyou nothing to be ashamed of.\nUpon the whole, what is to be done? You\r\nhave no inclination for any other person. His\r\nsituation in life, family, friends, and, above all, his\r\ncharacter, his uncommonly amiable mind, strict\r\nprinciples, just notions, good habits, all that you\r\nknow so well how to value, all that is really of\r\nthe first importance,\xe2\x80\x94everything of this nature\r\npleads his cause most strongly. You have no\r\ndoubt of his having superior abilities, he has\r\nproved it at the University; he is, I dare say,\r\nsuch a scholar as your agreeable, idle brothers\r\nwould ill bear a comparison with.\nOh, my dear Fanny! the more I write about\r\nhim the warmer my feelings become,\xe2\x80\x94the more\r\nstrongly I feel the sterling worth of such a young\r\nman, and the desirableness of your growing in love\r\nwith him again. I recommend this most thoroughly.\r\nThere are such beings in the world, perhaps one in\r\na thousand, as the creature you and I should think\r\nperfection, where grace and spirit are united to\r\nworth, where the manners are equal to the heart\r\nand understanding; but such a person may not\r\ncome in your way, or, if he does, he may not be\r\nthe eldest son of a man of fortune, the near relation\r\nof your particular friend, and belonging to\r\nyour own county.\nThink of all this, Fanny. Mr. A. has advantages\r\nwhich we do not often meet in one person.\r\nHis only fault, indeed, seems modesty. If he were\r\nless modest, he would be more agreeable, speak\r\nlouder, and look impudenter; and is not it a fine\r\ncharacter of which modesty is the only defect?\r\nI have no doubt he will get more lively and more\r\nlike yourselves as he is more with you; he will\r\ncatch your ways if he belongs to you. And as to\r\nthere being any objection from his goodness, from\r\nthe danger of his becoming even evangelical, I\r\ncannot admit that. I am by no means convinced\r\nthat we ought not all to be evangelicals, and am\r\nat least persuaded that they who are so from\r\nreason and feeling must be happiest and safest.\r\nDo not be frightened from the connection by your\r\nbrothers having most wit,\xe2\x80\x94wisdom is better than\r\nwit, and in the long run will certainly have the\r\nlaugh on her side; and don\'t be frightened by the\r\nidea of his acting more strictly up to the precepts\r\nof the New Testament than others.\nAnd now, my dear Fanny, having written so\r\nmuch on one side of the question, I shall turn\r\nround and entreat you not to commit yourself\r\nfarther, and not to think of accepting him unless\r\nyou really do like him. Anything is to be preferred\r\nor endured rather than marrying without\r\naffection; and if his deficiencies of manner, etc., etc.,\r\nstrike you more than all his good qualities, if you\r\ncontinue to think strongly of them, give him up\r\nat once. Things are now in such a state that you\r\nmust resolve upon one or the other,\xe2\x80\x94either to allow\r\nhim to go on as he has done, or whenever you are\r\ntogether behave with a coldness which may convince\r\nhim that he has been deceiving himself. I\r\nhave no doubt of his suffering a good deal for a\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x94a great deal when he feels that he must give\r\nyou up; but it is no creed of mine, as you must be\r\nwell aware, that such sort of disappointments kill\r\nanybody.\nYour sending the music was an admirable\r\ndevice, it made everything easy, and I do not\r\nknow how I could have accounted for the parcel\r\notherwise; for though your dear papa most conscientiously\r\nhunted about till he found me alone in\r\nthe dining-parlor, your Aunt C. had seen that he\r\nhad a parcel to deliver. As it was, however, I do\r\nnot think anything was suspected.\nWe have heard nothing fresh from Anna. I\r\ntrust she is very comfortable in her new home.\r\nHer letters have been very sensible and satisfactory,\r\nwith no parade of happiness, which I liked\r\nthem the better for. I have often known young\r\nmarried women write in a way I did not like in\r\nthat respect.\nYou will be glad to hear that the first edition\r\nof M. P. is all sold. Your Uncle Henry is rather\r\nwanting me to come to town to settle about a\r\nsecond edition; but as I could not very conveniently\r\nleave home now, I have written him my will and\r\npleasure and unless he still urges it, shall not go.\r\nI am very greedy and want to make the most of\r\nit; but as you are much above caring about\r\nmoney, I shall not plague you with any particulars.\r\nThe pleasures of vanity are more within your comprehension,\r\nand you will enter into mine at receiving\r\nthe praise which every now and then comes to\r\nme through some channel or other.\nSaturday.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Palmer spent yesterday with\r\nus, and is gone off with Cassy this morning. We\r\nhave been expecting Miss Lloyd the last two days,\r\nand feel sure of her to-day. Mr. Knight and Mr.\r\nEdwd. Knight are to dine with us, and on Monday\r\nthey are to dine with us again, accompanied by\r\ntheir respectable host and hostess.\nSunday.\xe2\x80\x94Your papa had given me messages to\r\nyou; but they are unnecessary, as he writes by this\r\npost to Aunt Louisa. We had a pleasant party\r\nyesterday; at least we found it so. It is delightful\r\nto see him so cheerful and confident. Aunt Cass.\r\nand I dine at the Great House to-day. We shall\r\nbe a snug half-dozen. Miss Lloyd came, as we expected,\r\nyesterday, and desires her love. She is\r\nvery happy to hear of your learning the harp. I\r\ndo not mean to send you what I owe Miss Hare,\r\nbecause I think you would rather not be paid\r\nbeforehand.\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94I met Harriet Benn yesterday.\r\nShe gave me her congratulations, and desired\r\nthey might be forwarded to you, and there they\r\nare. The chief news from this country is the\r\ndeath of old Mrs. Dormer. Mrs. Clement walks\r\nabout in a new black velvet pelisse lined with\r\nyellow, and a white bobbin net veil, and looks\r\nremarkably well in them.\nI think I understand the country about Hendon\r\nfrom your description. It must be very pretty in\r\nsummer. Should you know from the atmosphere\r\nthat you were within a dozen miles of London?\r\nMake everybody at Hendon admire "Mansfield\r\nPark."\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94I assure you we all came\r\naway very much pleased with our visit. We\r\ntalked of you for about a mile and a half with\r\ngreat satisfaction; and I have been just sending a\r\nvery good report of you to Miss Benn, with a full\r\naccount of your dress for Susan and Maria.\nWe were all at the play last night to see Miss\r\nO\'Neil in "Isabella." I do not think she was quite\r\nequal to my expectations. I fancy I want something\r\nmore than can be. I took two pocket-handkerchiefs,\r\nbut had very little occasion for either.\r\nShe is an elegant creature, however, and hugs Mr.\r\nYoung delightfully. I am going this morning to\r\nsee the little girls in Keppel Street. Cassy was\r\nexcessively interested about your marriage when\r\nshe heard of it, which was not until she was to\r\ndrink your health on the wedding-day.\nShe asked a thousand questions in her usual\r\nmanner, what he said to you and what you said to\r\nhim. If your uncle were at home he would send\r\nhis best love, but I will not impose any base\r\nfictitious remembrances on you; mine I can\r\nhonestly give, and remain\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94I have been very far from\r\nfinding your book an evil, I assure you. I read\r\nit immediately and with great pleasure. I think\r\nyou are going on very well. The description\r\nof Dr. Griffin and Lady Helena\'s unhappiness is\r\nvery good, and just what was likely to be. I am\r\ncurious to know what the end of them will be.\r\nThe name of Newton Priors is really invaluable; I\r\nnever met with anything superior to it. It is\r\ndelightful, and one could live on the name of Newton\r\nPriors for a twelvemonth. Indeed, I think\r\nyou get on very fast. I only wish other people of\r\nmy acquaintance could compose as rapidly. I am\r\npleased with the dog scene and with the whole of\r\nGeorge and Susan\'s love, but am more particularly\r\nstruck with your serious conversations. They are\r\nvery good throughout. St. Julian\'s history was\r\nquite a surprise to me. You had not very long\r\nknown it yourself, I suspect; but I have no objection\r\nto make to the circumstance, and it is very\r\nwell told. His having been in love with the aunt\r\ngives Cecilia an additional interest with him. I\r\nlike the idea,\xe2\x80\x94a very proper compliment to an\r\naunt! I rather imagine indeed that nieces are\r\nseldom chosen but out of compliment to some\r\naunt or another. I dare say Ben was in love with\r\nme once, and would never have thought of you if\r\nhe had not supposed me dead of scarlet fever.\r\nYes, I was in a mistake as to the number of books.\r\nI thought I had read three before the three at\r\nChawton, but fewer than six will not do. I want\r\nto see dear Bell Griffin again; and had you not\r\nbetter give some hint of St. Julian\'s early history\r\nin the beginning of the story?\nWe shall see nothing of Streatham while we\r\nare in town, as Mrs. Hill is to lie in of a daughter.\r\nMrs. Blackstone is to be with her. Mrs. Heathcote\r\nand Miss Bigg are just leaving. The latter\r\nwrites me word that Miss Blackford is married,\r\nbut I have never seen it in the papers, and one\r\nmay as well be single if the wedding is not to be\r\nin print.\nI am very much obliged to you, my dear Fanny,\r\nfor your letter, and I hope you will write again\r\nsoon, that I may know you to be all safe and happy\r\nat home.\nOur visit to Hendon will interest you, I am sure;\r\nbut I need not enter into the particulars of it, as\r\nyour papa will be able to answer almost every\r\nquestion. I certainly could describe her bedroom\r\nand her drawers and her closet better than he\r\ncan, but I do not feel that I can stop to do it. I\r\nwas rather sorry to hear that she is to have an instrument;\r\nit seems throwing money away. They\r\nwill wish the twenty-four guineas in the shape of\r\nsheets and towels six months hence; and as to her\r\nplaying, it never can be anything.\nHer purple pelisse rather surprised me. I\r\nthought we had known all paraphernalia of that\r\nsort. I do not mean to blame her; it looked very\r\nwell, and I dare say she wanted it. I suspect\r\nnothing worse than its being got in secret, and not\r\nowned to anybody. I received a very kind note\r\nfrom her yesterday, to ask me to come again and\r\nstay a night with them. I cannot do it, but I was\r\npleased to find that she had the power of doing so\r\nright a thing. My going was to give them both\r\npleasure very properly.\nI just saw Mr. Hayter at the play, and think\r\nhis face would please me on acquaintance. I was\r\nsorry he did not dine here. It seemed rather odd\r\nto me to be in the theatre with nobody to watch\r\nfor. I was quite composed myself, at leisure for\r\nall the agitated Isabella could raise.\nNow, my dearest Fanny, I will begin a subject\r\nwhich comes in very naturally. You frighten me\r\nout of my wits by your reference. Your affection\r\ngives me the highest pleasure, but indeed you must\r\nnot let anything depend on my opinion; your own\r\nfeelings, and none but your own, should determine\r\nsuch an important point. So far, however, as answering\r\nyour question, I have no scruple. I am\r\nperfectly convinced that your present feelings, supposing\r\nthat you were to marry now, would be sufficient\r\nfor his happiness; but when I think how very,\r\nvery far it is from a "now," and take everything\r\nthat may be into consideration, I dare not say,\r\n"Determine to accept him;" the risk is too great\r\nfor you, unless your own sentiments prompt it.\nYou will think me perverse, perhaps; in my last\r\nletter I was urging everything in his favor, and\r\nnow I am inclining the other way, but I cannot\r\nhelp it; I am at present more impressed with the\r\npossible evil that may arise to you from engaging\r\nyourself to him\xe2\x80\x94in word or mind\xe2\x80\x94than with\r\nanything else. When I consider how few young\r\nmen you have yet seen much of, how capable you\r\nare (yes, I do still think you very capable) of\r\nbeing really in love, and how full of temptation\r\nthe next six or seven years of your life will probably\r\nbe (it is the very period of life for the\r\nstrongest attachments to be formed),\xe2\x80\x94I cannot\r\nwish you, with your present very cool feelings, to\r\ndevote yourself in honor to him. It is very true\r\nthat you never may attach another man his equal\r\naltogether; but if that other man has the power of\r\nattaching you more, he will be in your eyes the\r\nmost perfect.\nI shall be glad if you can revive past feelings,\r\nand from your unbiassed self resolve to go on as\r\nyou have done, but this I do not expect; and without\r\nit I cannot wish you to be fettered. I should not\r\nbe afraid of your marrying him; with all his\r\nworth you would soon love him enough for the\r\nhappiness of both; but I should dread the continuance\r\nof this sort of tacit engagement, with\r\nsuch an uncertainty as there is of when it may be\r\ncompleted. Years may pass before he is independent;\r\nyou like him well enough to marry, but\r\nnot well enough to wait; the unpleasantness of appearing\r\nfickle is certainly great; but if you think\r\nyou want punishment for past illusions, there it is,\r\nand nothing can be compared to the misery of\r\nbeing bound without love,\xe2\x80\x94bound to one, and\r\npreferring another; that is a punishment which\r\nyou do not deserve.\nI know you did not meet, or rather will not\r\nmeet, to-day, as he called here yesterday; and I\r\nam glad of it. It does not seem very likely, at\r\nleast, that he should be in time for a dinner visit\r\nsixty miles off. We did not see him, only found\r\nhis card when we came home at four. Your\r\nUncle H. merely observed that he was a day after\r\n"the fair." We asked your brother on Monday\r\n(when Mr. Hayter was talked of) why he did not\r\ninvite him too; saying, "I know he is in town,\r\nfor I met him the other day in Bond St." Edward\r\nanswered that he did not know where he\r\nwas to be found. "Don\'t you know his chambers?"\r\n"No."\nI shall be most glad to hear from you again,\r\nmy dearest Fanny, but it must not be later than\r\nSaturday, as we shall be off on Monday long before\r\nthe letters are delivered; and write something\r\nthat may do to be read or told. I am to take\r\nthe Miss Moores back on Saturday, and when I\r\nreturn I shall hope to find your pleasant little\r\nflowing scrawl on the table. It will be a relief to\r\nme after playing at ma\'ams, for though I like\r\nMiss H. M. as much as one can at my time of life\r\nafter a day\'s acquaintance, it is uphill work to be\r\ntalking to those whom one knows so little.\nOnly one comes back with me to-morrow, probably\r\nMiss Eliza, and I rather dread it. We shall\r\nnot have two ideas in common. She is young,\r\npretty, chattering, and thinking chiefly, I presume,\r\nof dress, company, and admiration. Mr.\r\nSanford is to join us at dinner, which will be a\r\ncomfort, and in the evening, while your uncle\r\nand Miss Eliza play chess, he shall tell me comical\r\nthings and I will laugh at them, which will\r\nbe a pleasure to both.\nI called in Keppel Street and saw them all, including\r\ndear Uncle Charles, who is to come and\r\ndine with us quietly to-day. Little Harriot sat\r\nin my lap, and seemed as gentle and affectionate\r\nas ever, and as pretty, except not being quite\r\nwell. Fanny is a fine stout girl, talking incessantly,\r\nwith an interesting degree of lisp and\r\nindistinctness, and very likely may be the handsomest\r\nin time. Cassy did not show more pleasure\r\nin seeing me than her sisters, but I expected\r\nno better. She does not shine in the tender feelings.\r\nShe will never be a Miss O\'Neil, more in\r\nthe Mrs. Siddons line.\nThank you, but it is not settled yet whether I\r\ndo hazard a second edition. We are to see Egerton\r\nto-day, when it will probably be determined.\r\nPeople are more ready to borrow and praise than\r\nto buy, which I cannot wonder at; but though I\r\nlike praise as well as anybody, I like what\r\nEdward calls "Pewter" too. I hope he continues\r\ncareful of his eyes, and finds the good effect of\r\nit. I cannot suppose we differ in our ideas of the\r\nChristian religion. You have given an excellent\r\ndescription of it. We only affix a different meaning\r\nto the word evangelical.\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94We told Mr. B. Lefroy\r\nthat if the weather did not prevent us we should\r\ncertainly come and see you to-morrow and bring\r\nCassy, trusting to your being good enough to\r\ngive her a dinner about one o\'clock, that we might\r\nbe able to be with you the earlier and stay the\r\nlonger. But on giving Cassy her choice between\r\nthe Fair at Alton or Wyards, it must be confessed\r\nthat she has preferred the former, which we trust\r\nwill not greatly affront you; if it does, you may hope\r\nthat some little Anne hereafter may revenge the\r\ninsult by a similar preference of an Alton Fair to\r\nher Cousin Cassy. In the mean while we have\r\ndetermined to put off our visit to you until Monday,\r\nwhich we hope will be not less convenient.\r\nI wish the weather may not resolve on another put\r\noff. I must come to you before Wednesday if it be\r\npossible, for on that day I am going to London for\r\na week or two with your Uncle Henry, who is\r\nexpected here on Sunday. If Monday should\r\nappear too dirty for walking, and Mr. Lefroy would\r\nbe so kind as to come and fetch me, I should be\r\nmuch obliged to him. Cassy might be of the\r\nparty, and your Aunt Cassandra will take another\r\nopportunity.\nMy dear Anna,\xe2\x80\x94Cassy desires her best thanks\r\nfor the book. She was quite delighted to see it.\r\nI do not know when I have seen her so much\r\nstruck by anybody\'s kindness as on this occasion.\r\nHer sensibility seems to be opening to the perception\r\nof great actions. These gloves having appeared\r\non the pianoforte ever since you were here\r\non Friday, we imagine they must be yours. Mrs.\r\nDigweed returned yesterday through all the afternoon\'s\r\nrain, and was of course wet through; but in\r\nspeaking of it she never once said "it was beyond\r\neverything," which I am sure it must have been.\r\nYour mamma means to ride to Speen Hill to-morrow\r\nto see the Mrs. Hulberts, who are both very\r\nindifferent. By all accounts they really are\r\nbreaking now,\xe2\x80\x94not so stout as the old jackass.\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I have the pleasure\r\nof sending you a much better account of my\r\naffairs, which I know will be a great delight to\r\nyou.\n\nI wrote to Mr. Murray yesterday myself, and\r\nHenry wrote at the same time to Roworth. Before\r\nthe notes were out of the house, I received\r\nthree sheets and an apology from R. We sent the\r\nnotes, however, and I had a most civil one in\r\nreply from Mr. M. He is so very polite, indeed,\r\nthat it is quite overcoming. The printers have\r\nbeen waiting for paper,\xe2\x80\x94the blame is thrown upon\r\nthe stationer; but he gives his word that I shall\r\nhave no further cause for dissatisfaction. He has\r\nlent us Miss Williams and Scott, and says that\r\nany book of his will always be at my service. In\r\nshort, I am soothed and complimented into tolerable\r\ncomfort.\nWe had a visit yesterday from Edwd. Knight,\r\nand Mr. Mascall joined him here; and this morning\r\nhas brought Mr. Mascall\'s compliments and\r\ntwo pheasants. We have some hope of Edward\'s\r\ncoming to dinner to-day; he will, if he can, I\r\nbelieve. He is looking extremely well.\nTo-morrow Mr. Haden is to dine with us. There\r\nis happiness! We really grow so fond of Mr.\r\nHaden that I do not know what to expect. He\r\nand Mr. Tilson and Mr. Philips made up our circle\r\nof wits last night. Fanny played, and he sat and\r\nlistened and suggested improvements, till Richard\r\ncame in to tell him that "the doctor was waiting\r\nfor him at Captn. Blake\'s;" and then he was off\r\nwith a speed that you can imagine. He never\r\ndoes appear in the least above his profession or\r\nout of humor with it, or I should think poor Captn.\r\nBlake, whoever he is, in a very bad way.\nI must have misunderstood Henry when I told\r\nyou that you were to hear from him to-day. He\r\nread me what he wrote to Edward: part of it must\r\nhave amused him, I am sure one part, alas! cannot\r\nbe very amusing to anybody. I wonder that\r\nwith such business to worry him he can be getting\r\nbetter; but he certainly does gain strength, and\r\nif you and Edwd. were to see him now, I feel\r\nsure that you would think him improved since\r\nMonday.\nHe was out yesterday; it was a fine sunshiny\r\nday here (in the country perhaps you might have\r\nclouds and fogs. Dare I say so? I shall not deceive\r\nyou, if I do, as to my estimation of the\r\nclimate of London), and he ventured first on the\r\nbalcony and then as far as the greenhouse. He\r\ncaught no cold, and therefore has done more\r\nto-day, with great delight and self-persuasion of\r\nimprovement.\nHe has been to see Mrs. Tilson and the Malings.\r\nBy the by, you may talk to Mr. T. of\r\nhis wife\'s being better; I saw her yesterday, and\r\nwas sensible of her having gained ground in the\r\nlast two days.\nEvening.\xe2\x80\x94We have had no Edward. Our\r\ncircle is formed,\xe2\x80\x94only Mr. Tilson and Mr.\r\nHaden. We are not so happy as we were. A\r\nmessage came this afternoon from Mrs. Latouche\r\nand Miss East, offering themselves to drink tea\r\nwith us to-morrow, and, as it was accepted, here\r\nis an end of our extreme felicity in our dinner\r\nguest. I am heartily sorry they are coming; it\r\nwill be an evening spoilt to Fanny and me.\nAnother little disappointment: Mr. H. advises\r\nHenry\'s not venturing with us in the carriage\r\nto-morrow; if it were spring, he says, it would be\r\na different thing. One would rather this had not\r\nbeen. He seems to think his going out to-day\r\nrather imprudent, though acknowledging at the\r\nsame time that he is better than he was in the\r\nmorning.\nFanny has had a letter full of commissions from\r\nGoodnestone; we shall be busy about them and\r\nher own matters, I dare say, from twelve to four.\r\nNothing, I trust, will keep us from Keppel Street.\nThis day has brought a most friendly letter\r\nfrom Mr. Fowle, with a brace of pheasants. I\r\ndid not know before that Henry had written to\r\nhim a few days ago to ask for them. We shall\r\nlive upon pheasants,\xe2\x80\x94no bad life!\nI send you five one-pound notes, for fear you\r\nshould be distressed for little money. Lizzy\'s\r\nwork is charmingly done; shall you put it to your\r\nchintz? A sheet came in this moment; 1st and\r\n3rd vols. are now at 144; 2nd at 48. I am sure\r\nyou will like particulars. We are not to have\r\nthe trouble of returning the sheets to Mr. Murray\r\nany longer; the printer\'s boys bring and carry.\nI hope Mary continues to get well fast, and I\r\nsend my love to little Herbert. You will tell me\r\nmore of Martha\'s plans, of course, when you write\r\nagain. Remember me most kindly to everybody,\r\nand Miss Benn besides.\nMy dearest,\xe2\x80\x94The parcel arrived safely, and\r\nI am much obliged to you for your trouble. It\r\ncost 2s. 10d., but as there is a certain saving of\r\n2s. 4\xc2\xbdd. on the other side, I am sure it is well\r\nworth doing. I send four pair of silk stockings, but\r\nI do not want them washed at present. In the\r\nthree neckhandkerchiefs I include the one sent\r\ndown before. These things, perhaps, Edwd. may\r\nbe able to bring, but even if he is not, I am extremely\r\npleased with his returning to you from\r\nSteventon. It is much better, far preferable.\nI did mention the P. R. in my note to Mr.\r\nMurray; it brought me a fine compliment in\r\nreturn. Whether it has done any other good I do\r\nnot know, but Henry thought it worth trying.\nThe printers continue to supply me very well.\r\nI am advanced in Vol. III. to my arra-root, upon\r\nwhich peculiar style of spelling there is a modest\r\nquery in the margin. I will not forget Anna\'s\r\narrowroot. I hope you have told Martha of my\r\nfirst resolution of letting nobody know that I\r\nmight dedicate, etc., for fear of being obliged\r\nto do it, and that she is thoroughly convinced\r\nof my being influenced now by nothing but the\r\nmost mercenary motives. I have paid nine shillings\r\non her account to Miss Palmer; there was\r\nno more owing.\nWell, we were very busy all yesterday; from\r\nhalf-past eleven till four in the streets, working almost\r\nentirely for other people, driving from place\r\nto place after a parcel for Sandling, which we could\r\nnever find, and encountering the miseries of\r\nGrafton House to get a purple frock for Eleanor\r\nBridges. We got to Keppel St., however, which\r\nwas all I cared for; and though we could stay only\r\na quarter of an hour, Fanny\'s calling gave great\r\npleasure, and her sensibility still greater, for she\r\nwas very much affected at the sight of the children.\r\nPoor little F. looked heavy. We saw the\r\nwhole party.\nAunt Harriet hopes Cassy will not forget to\r\nmake a pincushion for Mrs. Kelly, as she has spoken\r\nof its being promised her several times. I hope\r\nwe shall see Aunt H. and the dear little girls here\r\non Thursday.\nSo much for the morning. Then came the dinner\r\nand Mr. Haden, who brought good manners\r\nand clever conversation. From seven to eight the\r\nharp; at eight Mrs. L. and Miss E. arrived, and for\r\nthe rest of the evening the drawing-room was thus\r\narranged: on the sofa side the two ladies, Henry,\r\nand myself making the best of it; on the opposite\r\nside Fanny and Mr. Haden, in two chairs (I believe,\r\nat least, they had two chairs), talking together\r\nuninterruptedly. Fancy the scene! And what\r\nis to be fancied next? Why, that Mr. H. dines\r\nhere again to-morrow. To-day we are to have Mr.\r\nBarlow. Mr. H. is reading "Mansfield Park" for\r\nthe first time, and prefers it to P. and P.\nA hare and four rabbits from Gm. yesterday,\r\nso that we are stocked for nearly a week. Poor\r\nFarmer Andrews! I am very sorry for him, and\r\nsincerely wish his recovery.\nA better account of the sugar than I could have\r\nexpected. I should like to help you break some\r\nmore. I am glad you cannot wake early; I am sure\r\nyou must have been under great arrears of rest.\n\nFanny and I have been to B. Chapel, and\r\nwalked back with Maria Cuthbert. We have been\r\nvery little plagued with visitors this last week.\r\nI remember only Miss Herries, the aunt, but I am\r\nin terror for to-day, a fine bright Sunday; plenty\r\nof mortar, and nothing to do.\nHenry gets out in his garden every day, but at\r\npresent his inclination for doing more seems over,\r\nnor has he now any plan for leaving London\r\nbefore Dec. 18, when he thinks of going to Oxford\r\nfor a few days; to-day, indeed, his feelings are for\r\ncontinuing where he is through the next two\r\nmonths.\nOne knows the uncertainty of all this; but\r\nshould it be so, we must think the best, and hope\r\nthe best, and do the best; and my idea in that\r\ncase is, that when he goes to Oxford I should go\r\nhome, and have nearly a week of you before you\r\ntake my place. This is only a silent project, you\r\nknow, to be gladly given up if better things occur.\r\nHenry calls himself stronger every day, and Mr.\r\nH. keeps on approving his pulse, which seems\r\ngenerally better than ever, but still they will not\r\nlet him be well. Perhaps when Fanny is gone he\r\nwill be allowed to recover faster.\nI am not disappointed: I never thought the\r\nlittle girl at Wyards very pretty, but she will\r\nhave a fine complexion and curly hair, and pass for\r\na beauty. We are glad the mamma\'s cold has\r\nnot been worse, and send her our love and good\r\nwishes by every convenient opportunity. Sweet,\r\namiable Frank! why does he have a cold too?\r\nLike Captain Mirvan to Mr. Duval, "I wish it\r\nwell over with him."\nFanny has heard all that I have said to you\r\nabout herself and Mr. H. Thank you very much\r\nfor the sight of dearest Charles\'s letter to yourself.\r\nHow pleasantly and how naturally he writes! and\r\nhow perfect a picture of his disposition and feelings\r\nhis style conveys! Poor dear fellow! Not a\r\npresent!\nI have a great mind to send him all the twelve\r\ncopies which were to have been dispersed among\r\nmy near connections, beginning with the P. R.\r\nand ending with Countess Morley. Adieu.\nMy dear Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94Henry came back\r\nyesterday, and might have returned the day before\r\nif he had known as much in time. I had the\r\npleasure of hearing from Mr. T. on Wednesday\r\nnight that Mr. Seymour thought there was not the\r\nleast occasion for his absenting himself any longer.\nI had also the comfort of a few lines on Wednesday\r\nmorning from Henry himself, just after your\r\nletter was gone, giving so good an account of his\r\nfeelings as made me perfectly easy. He met with\r\nthe utmost care and attention at Hanwell, spent\r\nhis two days there very quietly and pleasantly,\r\nand being certainly in no respect the worse for\r\ngoing, we may believe that he must be better, as he\r\nis quite sure of being himself. To make his return\r\na complete gala, Mr. Haden was secured for dinner.\r\nI need not say that our evening was agreeable.\nBut you seem to be under a mistake as to Mr. H.\r\nYou call him an apothecary. He is no apothecary;\r\nhe has never been an apothecary; there is not an\r\napothecary in this neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x94the only inconvenience\r\nof the situation, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x94but so it is;\r\nwe have not a medical man within reach. He is a\r\nHaden, nothing but a Haden, a sort of wonderful\r\nnondescript creature on two legs, something between\r\na man and an angel, but without the least\r\nspice of an apothecary. He is, perhaps, the only\r\nperson not an apothecary hereabouts. He has\r\nnever sung to us. He will not sing without a\r\npianoforte accompaniment.\nMr. Meyers gives his three lessons a week, altering\r\nhis days and his hours, however, just as he\r\nchooses, never very punctual, and never giving\r\ngood measure. I have not Fanny\'s fondness for\r\nmasters, and Mr. Meyers does not give me any\r\nlonging after them. The truth is, I think, that\r\nthey are all, at least music-masters, made of too\r\nmuch consequence, and allowed to take too many\r\nliberties with their scholars\' time.\nWe shall be delighted to see Edward on Monday,\r\nonly sorry that you must be losing him. A\r\nturkey will be equally welcome with himself. He\r\nmust prepare for his own proper bedchamber here,\r\nas Henry moved down to the one below last week;\r\nhe found the other cold.\nI am sorry my mother has been suffering, and\r\nam afraid this exquisite weather is too good to\r\nagree with her. I enjoy it all over me, from top\r\nto toe, from right to left, longitudinally, perpendicularly,\r\ndiagonally; and I cannot but selfishly\r\nhope we are to have it last till Christmas,\xe2\x80\x94nice,\r\nunwholesome, unseasonable, relaxing, close, muggy\r\nweather.\nOh, thank you very much for your long letter;\r\nit did me a great deal of good. Henry accepts\r\nyour offer of making his nine gallon of mead\r\nthankfully. The mistake of the dogs rather vexed\r\nhim for a moment, but he has not thought of it\r\nsince. To-day he makes a third attempt at his\r\nstrengthening plaister, and as I am sure he will\r\nnow be getting out a great deal, it is to be wished\r\nthat he may be able to keep it on. He sets off\r\nthis morning by the Chelsea coach to sign bonds\r\nand visit Henrietta St., and I have no doubt will\r\nbe going every day to Henrietta St.\nFanny and I were very snug by ourselves as\r\nsoon as we were satisfied about our invalid\'s being\r\nsafe at Hanwell. By man[oe]uvring and good luck\r\nwe foiled all the Malings\' attempts upon us. Happily\r\nI caught a little cold on Wednesday, the\r\nmorning we were in town, which we made very\r\nuseful, and we saw nobody but our precious and\r\nMr. Tilson.\nThis evening the Malings are allowed to drink\r\ntea with us. We are in hopes\xe2\x80\x94that is, we wish\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nPalmer and the little girls may come this\r\nmorning. You know, of course, that she could\r\nnot come on Thursday, and she will not attempt\r\nto name any other day.\nGod bless you. Excuse the shortness of this,\r\nbut I must finish it now, that I may save you 2d.\r\nBest love.\nMy dearest Fanny,\xe2\x80\x94You are inimitable, irresistible.\r\nYou are the delight of my life. Such\r\nletters, such entertaining letters, as you have\r\nlately sent! such a description of your queer\r\nlittle heart! such a lovely display of what imagination\r\ndoes! You are worth your weight in gold,\r\nor even in the new silver coinage. I cannot express\r\nto you what I have felt in reading your\r\nhistory of yourself,\xe2\x80\x94how full of pity and concern,\r\nand admiration and amusement I have been!\r\nYou are the paragon of all that is silly and sensible,\r\ncommonplace and eccentric, sad and lively,\r\nprovoking and interesting. Who can keep pace\r\nwith the fluctuations of your fancy, the capprizios\r\nof your taste, the contradictions of your feelings?\r\nYou are so odd, and all the time so perfectly\r\nnatural!\xe2\x80\x94so peculiar in yourself, and yet so like\r\neverybody else!\nIt is very, very gratifying to me to know you\r\nso intimately. You can hardly think what a pleasure\r\nit is to me to have such thorough pictures of\r\nyour heart. Oh, what a loss it will be when you\r\nare married! You are too agreeable in your single\r\nstate,\xe2\x80\x94too agreeable as a niece. I shall hate you\r\nwhen your delicious play of mind is all settled\r\ndown into conjugal and maternal affections.\nMr. B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 frightens me. He will have you. I\r\nsee you at the altar. I have some faith in Mrs. C.\r\nCage\'s observation, and still more in Lizzy\'s; and\r\nbesides, I know it must be so. He must be wishing\r\nto attach you. It would be too stupid and\r\ntoo shameful in him to be otherwise; and all the\r\nfamily are seeking your acquaintance.\nDo not imagine that I have any real objection;\r\nI have rather taken a fancy to him than not, and I\r\nlike the house for you. I only do not like you\r\nshould marry anybody. And yet I do wish you\r\nto marry very much, because I know you will\r\nnever be happy till you are; but the loss of\r\na Fanny Knight will be never made up to me.\r\nMy "affec. niece F. C. B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94" will be but a poor\r\nsubstitute. I do not like your being nervous, and\r\nso apt to cry,\xe2\x80\x94it is a sign you are not quite well;\r\nbut I hope Mr. Scud\xe2\x80\x94as you always write his\r\nname (your Mr. Scuds amuse me very much)\xe2\x80\x94will\r\ndo you good.\nWhat a comfort that Cassandra should be so\r\nrecovered! It was more than we had expected.\r\nI can easily believe she was very patient and very\r\ngood. I always loved Cassandra for her fine dark\r\neyes and sweet temper. I am almost entirely\r\ncured of my rheumatism,\xe2\x80\x94just a little pain in my\r\nknee now and then, to make me remember what it\r\nwas, and keep on flannel. Aunt Cassandra nursed\r\nme so beautifully.\nI enjoy your visit to Goodnestone, it must be a\r\ngreat pleasure to you; you have not seen Fanny\r\nCage in comfort so long. I hope she represents\r\nand remonstrates and reasons with you properly.\r\nWhy should you be living in dread of his marrying\r\nsomebody else? (Yet how natural!) You did not\r\nchoose to have him yourself, why not allow him to\r\ntake comfort where he can? In your conscience\r\nyou know that he could not bear a companion\r\nwith a more animated character. You cannot\r\nforget how you felt under the idea of its having\r\nbeen possible that he might have dined in Hans\r\nPlace.\nMy dearest Fanny, I cannot bear you should\r\nbe unhappy about him. Think of his principles;\r\nthink of his father\'s objection, of want of money,\r\netc., etc. But I am doing no good; no, all that I\r\nurge against him will rather make you take his\r\npart more,\xe2\x80\x94sweet, perverse Fanny.\nAnd now I will tell you that we like your\r\nHenry to the utmost, to the very top of the glass,\r\nquite brimful. He is a very pleasing young man.\r\nI do not see how he could be mended. He does\r\nreally bid fair to be everything his father and sister\r\ncould wish; and William I love very much indeed,\r\nand so we do all; he is quite our own William.\r\nIn short, we are very comfortable together; that\r\nis, we can answer for ourselves.\nMrs. Deedes is as welcome as May to all our\r\nbenevolence to her son; we only lamented that we\r\ncould not do more, and that the 50l. note we slipped\r\ninto his hand at parting was necessarily the limit\r\nof our offering. Good Mrs. Deedes! Scandal and\r\ngossip; yes, I dare say you are well stocked, but\r\nI am very fond of Mrs. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 for reasons good.\r\nThank you for mentioning her praise of "Emma,"\r\netc.\nI have contributed the marking to Uncle H.\'s\r\nshirts, and now they are a complete memorial of\r\nthe tender regard of many.\nFriday.\xe2\x80\x94I had no idea when I began this yesterday\r\nof sending it before your brother went back,\r\nbut I have written away my foolish thoughts at\r\nsuch a rate that I will not keep them many hours\r\nlonger to stare me in the face.\nMuch obliged for the quadrilles, which I am\r\ngrown to think pretty enough, though of course\r\nthey are very inferior to the cotillons of my own\r\nday.\nBen and Anna walked here last Sunday to hear\r\nUncle Henry, and she looked so pretty, it was quite\r\na pleasure to see her, so young and so blooming\r\nand so innocent, as if she had never had a wicked\r\nthought in her life, which yet one has some reason\r\nto suppose she must have had, if we believe the\r\ndoctrine of original sin. I hope Lizzy will have\r\nher play very kindly arranged for her. Henry is\r\ngenerally thought very good-looking, but not so\r\nhandsome as Edward. I think I prefer his face.\r\nWm. is in excellent looks, has a fine appetite,\r\nand seems perfectly well. You will have a great\r\nbreak up at Godmersham in the spring. You must\r\nfeel their all going. It is very right, however!\r\nPoor Miss C.! I shall pity her when she begins\r\nto understand herself.\nYour objection to the quadrilles delighted me\r\nexceedingly. Pretty well, for a lady irrecoverably\r\nattached to one person! Sweet Fanny, believe no\r\nsuch thing of yourself, spread no such malicious\r\nslander upon your understanding within the precincts\r\nof your imagination. Do not speak ill of\r\nyour sense merely for the gratification of your\r\nfancy; yours is sense which deserves more honorable\r\ntreatment. You are not in love with him;\r\nyou never have been really in love with him.\nAs to making any adequate return for such a\r\nletter as yours, my dearest Fanny, it is absolutely\r\nimpossible. If I were to labor at it all the rest\r\nof my life, and live to the age of Methuselah, I\r\ncould never accomplish anything so long and so\r\nperfect; but I cannot let William go without a\r\nfew lines of acknowledgment and reply.\nI have pretty well done with Mr. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. By\r\nyour description, he cannot be in love with you,\r\nhowever he may try at it; and I could not wish the\r\nmatch unless there were a great deal of love on his\r\nside. I do not know what to do about Jemima\r\nBranfill. What does her dancing away with so\r\nmuch spirit mean? That she does not care for\r\nhim, or only wishes to appear not to care for him?\r\nWho can understand a young lady?\nPoor Mrs. C. Milles, that she should die on the\r\nwrong day at last, after being about it so long!\r\nIt was unlucky that the Goodnestone party could\r\nnot meet you; and I hope her friendly, obliging,\r\nsocial spirit, which delighted in drawing people\r\ntogether, was not conscious of the division and\r\ndisappointment she was occasioning. I am sorry\r\nand surprised that you speak of her as having little\r\nto leave, and must feel for Miss Milles, though she\r\nis Molly, if a material loss of income is to attend\r\nher other loss. Single women have a dreadful\r\npropensity for being poor, which is one very strong\r\nargument in favor of matrimony; but I need not\r\ndwell on such arguments with you, pretty dear.\nTo you I shall say, as I have often said before,\r\nDo not be in a hurry, the right man will come at\r\nlast; you will in the course of the next two or\r\nthree years meet with somebody more generally\r\nunexceptionable than any one you have yet known,\r\nwho will love you as warmly as possible, and who\r\nwill so completely attract you that you will feel\r\nyou never really loved before.\nDo none of the A.\'s ever come to balls now?\r\nYou have never mentioned them as being at any.\r\nAnd what do you hear of the Gripps, or of Fanny\r\nand her husband?\nAunt Cassandra walked to Wyards yesterday\r\nwith Mrs. Digweed. Anna has had a bad cold,\r\nand looks pale. She has just weaned Julia.\nI have also heard lately from your Aunt Harriot,\r\nand cannot understand their plans in parting\r\nwith Miss S., whom she seems very much to value\r\nnow that Harriot and Eleanor are both of an age\r\nfor a governess to be so useful to, especially as,\r\nwhen Caroline was sent to school some years, Miss\r\nBell was still retained, though the others even\r\nthen were nursery children. They have some\r\ngood reason, I dare say, though I cannot penetrate\r\nit; and till I know what it is I shall invent a bad\r\none, and amuse myself with accounting for the\r\ndifference of measures by supposing Miss S. to be\r\na superior sort of woman, who has never stooped\r\nto recommend herself to the master of the family\r\nby flattery, as Miss Bell did.\nI will answer your kind questions more than\r\nyou expect. "Miss Catherine" is put upon the\r\nshelf for the present, and I do not know that she\r\nwill ever come out; but I have a something ready\r\nfor publication, which may, perhaps, appear about\r\na twelvemonth hence. It is short,\xe2\x80\x94about the\r\nlength of "Catherine." This is for yourself\r\nalone. Neither Mr. Salusbury nor Mr. Wildman\r\nis to know of it.\nI am got tolerably well again, quite equal to\r\nwalking about and enjoying the air, and by sitting\r\ndown and resting a good while between my\r\nwalks I get exercise enough. I have a scheme,\r\nhowever, for accomplishing more, as the weather\r\ngrows spring-like. I mean to take to riding the\r\ndonkey; it will be more independent and less\r\ntroublesome than the use of the carriage, and I\r\nshall be able to go about with Aunt Cassandra in\r\nher walks to Alton and Wyards.\nI hope you will think Wm. looking well; he\r\nwas bilious the other day, and At. Cass. supplied\r\nhim with a dose at his own request. I am sure\r\nyou would have approved it. Wm. and I are the\r\nbest of friends. I love him very much. Everything\r\nis so natural about him,\xe2\x80\x94his affections,\r\nhis manners, and his drollery. He entertains and\r\ninterests us extremely.\nMat. Hammond and A. M. Shaw are people\r\nwhom I cannot care for in themselves, but I enter\r\ninto their situation, and am glad they are so\r\nhappy. If I were the Duchess of Richmond, I\r\nshould be very miserable about my son\'s choice.\nOur fears increase for poor little Harriot; the\r\nlatest account is that Sir Ev. Home is confirmed\r\nin his opinion of there being water on the brain.\r\nI hope Heaven, in its mercy, will take her soon.\r\nHer poor father will be quite worn out by his feelings\r\nfor her; he cannot spare Cassy at present, she\r\nis an occupation and a comfort to him.\nI am very much obliged to you, my dearest\r\nFanny, for sending me Mr. W.\'s conversation; I\r\nhad great amusement in reading it, and I hope\r\nI am not affronted, and do not think the worse\r\nof him for having a brain so very different from\r\nmine; but my strongest sensation of all is astonishment\r\nat your being able to press him on the\r\nsubject so perseveringly; and I agree with your\r\npapa that it was not fair. When he knows the\r\ntruth, he will be uncomfortable.\nYou are the oddest creature! Nervous enough\r\nin some respects, but in others perfectly without\r\nnerves! Quite unrepulsable, hardened, and impudent.\r\nDo not oblige him to read any more.\r\nHave mercy on him, tell him the truth, and make\r\nhim an apology. He and I should not in the least\r\nagree, of course, in our ideas of novels and heroines.\r\nPictures of perfection, as you know, make\r\nme sick and wicked; but there is some very good\r\nsense in what he says, and I particularly respect\r\nhim for wishing to think well of all young ladies;\r\nit shows an amiable and a delicate mind. And he\r\ndeserves better treatment than to be obliged to\r\nread any more of my works.\nDo not be surprised at finding Uncle Henry acquainted\r\nwith my having another ready for publication.\r\nI could not say No when he asked me,\r\nbut he knows nothing more of it. You will not\r\nlike it, so you need not be impatient. You may\r\nperhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good\r\nfor me.\nMany thanks for your kind care for my health;\r\nI certainly have not been well for many weeks,\r\nand about a week ago I was very poorly. I have\r\nhad a good deal of fever at times, and indifferent\r\nnights; but I am considerably better now, and am\r\nrecovering my looks a little, which have been bad\r\nenough,\xe2\x80\x94black and white, and every wrong color.\r\nI must not depend upon being ever very blooming\r\nagain. Sickness is a dangerous indulgence at my\r\ntime of life. Thank you for everything you tell\r\nme. I do not feel worthy of it by anything that\r\nI can say in return, but I assure you my pleasure\r\nin your letters is quite as great as ever, and I am\r\ninterested and amused just as you could wish me.\r\nIf there is a Miss Marsden, I perceive whom she\r\nwill marry.\nEvening.\xe2\x80\x94I was languid and dull and very bad\r\ncompany when I wrote the above; I am better\r\nnow, to my own feelings at least, and wish I may\r\nbe more agreeable. We are going to have rain,\r\nand after that very pleasant genial weather, which\r\nwill exactly do for me, as my saddle will then be\r\ncompleted, and air and exercise is what I want.\r\nIndeed, I shall be very glad when the event at\r\nScarlets is over, the expectation of it keeps us\r\nin a worry, your grandmamma especially; she sits\r\nbrooding over evils which cannot be remedied, and\r\nconduct impossible to be understood.\nNow the reports from Keppel St. are rather\r\nbetter; little Harriot\'s headaches are abated, and\r\nSir Evd. is satisfied with the effect of the mercury,\r\nand does not despair of a cure. The complaint I\r\nfind is not considered incurable nowadays, provided\r\nthe patient be young enough not to have the head\r\nhardened. The water in that case may be drawn\r\noff by mercury. But though this is a new idea to\r\nus, perhaps it may have been long familiar to you\r\nthrough your friend Mr. Scud. I hope his high\r\nrenown is sustained by driving away William\'s\r\ncough.\nTell Wm. that Triggs is as beautiful and condescending\r\nas ever, and was so good as to dine\r\nwith us to-day, and tell him that I often play at\r\nnines and think of him.\nThe Papillons came back on Friday night, but\r\nI have not seen them yet, as I do not venture to\r\nchurch. I cannot hear, however, but that they\r\nare the same Mr. P. and his sister they used to\r\nbe. She has engaged a new maidservant in Mrs.\r\nCalker\'s room, whom she means to make also\r\nhousekeeper under herself.\nOld Philmore was buried yesterday, and I, by\r\nway of saying something to Triggs, observed that\r\nit had been a very handsome funeral; but his\r\nmanner of reply made me suppose that it was not\r\ngenerally esteemed so. I can only be sure of one\r\npart being very handsome,\xe2\x80\x94Triggs himself, walking\r\nbehind in his green coat. Mrs. Philmore\r\nattended as chief mourner, in bombazine, made\r\nvery short, and flounced with crape.\nTuesday.\xe2\x80\x94I have had various plans as to this\r\nletter, but at last I have determined that Uncle\r\nHenry shall forward it from London. I want to\r\nsee how Canterbury looks in the direction. When\r\nonce Uncle H. has left us, I shall wish him with\r\nyou. London has become a hateful place to him,\r\nand he is always depressed by the idea of it. I\r\nhope he will be in time for your sick. I am sure\r\nhe must do that part of his duty as excellently as\r\nall the rest. He returned yesterday from Steventon,\r\nand was with us by breakfast, bringing\r\nEdward with him, only that Edwd. stayed to\r\nbreakfast at Wyards. We had a pleasant family\r\nday, for the Altons dined with us, the last visit\r\nof the kind probably which she will be able to pay\r\nus for many a month.\nI hope your own Henry is in France, and that\r\nyou have heard from him; the passage once over,\r\nhe will feel all happiness. I took my first ride\r\nyesterday, and liked it very much. I went up\r\nMounter\'s Lane and round by where the new\r\ncottages are to be, and found the exercise and\r\neverything very pleasant; and I had the advantage\r\nof agreeable companions, as At. Cass. and Edward\r\nwalked by my side. At. Cass. is such an excellent\r\nnurse, so assiduous and unwearied! But you know\r\nall that already.\nMy dearest Cassandra,\xe2\x80\x94I have borne the\r\narrival of your letter to-day extremely well; anybody\r\nmight have thought it was giving me pleasure.\r\nI am very glad you find so much to be\r\nsatisfied with at Cheltenham. While the waters\r\nagree, everything else is trifling.\nA letter arrived for you from Charles last Thursday.\r\nThey are all safe and pretty well in Keppel\r\nSt., the children decidedly better for Broadstairs;\r\nand he writes principally to ask when it will be\r\nconvenient to us to receive Miss P., the little\r\ngirls, and himself. They would be ready to set\r\noff in ten days from the time of his writing, to pay\r\ntheir visits in Hampshire and Berkshire, and he\r\nwould prefer coming to Chawton first.\nI have answered him, and said that we hoped it\r\nmight suit them to wait till the last week in Septr.,\r\nas we could not ask them sooner, either on your\r\naccount or the want of room. I mentioned the\r\n23rd as the probable day of your return. When\r\nyou have once left Cheltenham, I shall grudge\r\nevery half-day wasted on the road. If there were\r\nbut a coach from Hungerford to Chawton! I have\r\ndesired him to let me hear again soon.\nHe does not include a maid in the list to be\r\naccommodated; but if they bring one, as I suppose\r\nthey will, we shall have no bed in the house even\r\nthen for Charles himself,\xe2\x80\x94let alone Henry. But\r\nwhat can we do?\nWe shall have the Gt. House quite at our command;\r\nit is to be cleared of the Papillons\' servants\r\nin a day or two. They themselves have\r\nbeen hurried off into Essex to take possession,\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nof a large estate left them by an uncle, but\r\nto scrape together all they can, I suppose, of the\r\neffects of a Mrs. Rawstorn, a rich old friend and\r\ncousin suddenly deceased, to whom they are joint\r\nexecutors. So there is a happy end of the Kentish\r\nPapillons coming here.\nNo morning service to-day, wherefore I am\r\nwriting between twelve and one o\'clock. Mr.\r\nBenn in the afternoon, and likewise more rain\r\nagain, by the look and the sound of things. You\r\nleft us in doubt of Mrs. Benn\'s situation, but she\r\nhas bespoke her nurse.... The F. A.\'s dined with\r\nus yesterday, and had fine weather both for coming\r\nand going home, which has hardly ever happened\r\nto them before. She is still unprovided with a\r\nhousemaid.\nOur day at Alton was very pleasant, venison\r\nquite right, children well behaved, and Mr. and\r\nMrs. Digweed taking kindly to our charades and\r\nother games. I must also observe, for his mother\'s\r\nsatisfaction, that Edward at my suggestion devoted\r\nhimself very properly to the entertainment\r\nof Miss S. Gibson. Nothing was wanting except\r\nMr. Sweeney; but he, alas! had been ordered\r\naway to London the day before. We had a beautiful\r\nwalk home by moonlight.\nThank you, my back has given me scarcely any\r\npain for many days. I have an idea that agitation\r\ndoes it as much harm as fatigue, and that\r\nI was ill at the time of your going from the very\r\ncircumstance of your going. I am nursing myself\r\nup now into as beautiful a state as I can,\r\nbecause I hear that Dr. White means to call on\r\nme before he leaves the country.\nEvening.\xe2\x80\x94Frank and Mary and the children\r\nvisited us this morning. Mr. and Mrs. Gibson\r\nare to come on the 23rd, and there is too much\r\nreason to fear they will stay above a week. Little\r\nGeorge could tell me where you were gone to, as\r\nwell as what you were to bring him, when I asked\r\nhim the other day.\nSir Tho. Miller is dead. I treat you with a\r\ndead baronet in almost every letter.\nSo you have C. Craven among you, as well as\r\nthe Duke of Orleans and Mr. Pocock. But it\r\nmortifies me that you have not added one to the\r\nstock of common acquaintance. Do pray meet\r\nwith somebody belonging to yourself. I am quite\r\nweary of your knowing nobody.\nMrs. Digweed parts with both Hannah and old\r\ncook: the former will not give up her lover, who\r\nis a man of bad character; the latter is guilty\r\nonly of being unequal to anything.\nMiss Terry was to have spent this week with\r\nher sister, but as usual it is put off. My amiable\r\nfriend knows the value of her company. I have\r\nnot seen Anna since the day you left us; her\r\nfather and brother visited her most days. Edward\r\nand Ben called here on Thursday. Edward was\r\nin his way to Selborne. We found him very\r\nagreeable. He is come back from France, thinking\r\nof the French as one could wish,\xe2\x80\x94disappointed\r\nin everything. He did not go beyond\r\nParis.\nI have a letter from Mrs. Perigord; she and\r\nher mother are in London again. She speaks of\r\nFrance as a scene of general poverty and misery:\r\nno money, no trade, nothing to be got but by\r\nthe innkeepers, and as to her own present prospects\r\nshe is not much less melancholy than before.\nI have also a letter from Miss Sharp, quite one\r\nof her letters; she has been again obliged to\r\nexert herself more than ever, in a more distressing,\r\nmore harassed state, and has met with another\r\nexcellent old physician and his wife, with\r\nevery virtue under heaven, who takes to her and\r\ncures her from pure love and benevolence. Dr.\r\nand Mrs. Storer are their Mrs. and Miss Palmer\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthey are at Bridlington. I am happy to say,\r\nhowever, that the sum of the account is better\r\nthan usual. Sir William is returned; from\r\nBridlington they go to Chevet, and she is to have\r\na young governess under her.\nI enjoyed Edward\'s company very much, as I\r\nsaid before, and yet I was not sorry when Friday\r\ncame. It had been a busy week, and I wanted a\r\nfew days\' quiet and exemption from the thought\r\nand contrivancy which any sort of company gives.\r\nI often wonder how you can find time for what\r\nyou do, in addition to the care of the house; and\r\nhow good Mrs. West could have written such\r\nbooks and collected so many hard words, with\r\nall her family cares, is still more a matter of\r\nastonishment. Composition seems to me impossible\r\nwith a head full of joints of mutton and doses\r\nof rhubarb.\nMonday.\xe2\x80\x94Here is a sad morning. I fear you\r\nmay not have been able to get to the Pump. The\r\ntwo last days were very pleasant. I enjoyed them\r\nthe more for your sake. But to-day it is really\r\nbad enough to make you all cross. I hope Mary\r\nwill change her lodgings at the fortnight\'s end;\r\nI am sure, if you looked about well, you would\r\nfind others in some odd corner to suit you better.\r\nMrs. Potter charges for the name of the\r\nHigh St.\nSuccess to the pianoforte! I trust it will drive\r\nyou away. We hear now that there is to be no\r\nhoney this year. Bad news for us. We must husband\r\nour present stock of mead, and I am sorry\r\nto perceive that our twenty gallons is very nearly\r\nout. I cannot comprehend how the fourteen gallons\r\ncould last so long.\nWe do not much like Mr. Cooper\'s new sermons.\r\nThey are fuller of regeneration and conversion\r\nthan ever, with the addition of his zeal in the\r\ncause of the Bible Society.\nMartha\'s love to Mary and Caroline, and she is\r\nextremely glad to find they like the pelisse. The\r\nDebarys are indeed odious! We are to see my\r\nbrother to-morrow, but for only one night. I\r\nhad no idea that he would care for the races\r\nwithout Edward. Remember me to all.\nYm raed Yssac,\xe2\x80\x94I hsiw uoy a yppah wen raey.\r\nRuoy xis snisuoc emac ereh yadretsey, dna dah\r\nhcae a eceip fo ekac.

She did\r\nlove you most sincerely, and never shall I forget\r\nthe proofs of love you gave her during her illness\r\nin writing those kind, amusing letters at a time\r\nwhen I know your feelings would have dictated so\r\ndifferent a style. Take the only reward I can give\r\nyou in the assurance that your benevolent purpose\r\nwas answered; you did contribute to her\r\nenjoyment.\nEven your last letter afforded pleasure. I\r\nmerely cut the seal and gave it to her; she opened\r\nit and read it herself, afterwards she gave it to me\r\nto read, and then talked to me a little and not uncheerfully\r\nof its contents, but there was then a\r\nlanguor about her which prevented her taking the\r\nsame interest in anything she had been used to do.\nSince Tuesday evening, when her complaint returned,\r\nthere was a visible change, she slept more\r\nand much more comfortably; indeed, during the\r\nlast eight-and-forty hours she was more asleep than\r\nawake. Her looks altered and she fell away, but\r\nI perceived no material diminution of strength,\r\nand though I was then hopeless of a recovery, I\r\nhad no suspicion how rapidly my loss was\r\napproaching.\nI have lost a treasure, such a sister, such a\r\nfriend as never can have been surpassed. She was\r\nthe sun of my life, the gilder of every pleasure,\r\nthe soother of every sorrow; I had not a thought\r\nconcealed from her, and it is as if I had lost a part\r\nof myself. I loved her only too well,\xe2\x80\x94not better\r\nthan she deserved, but I am conscious that my\r\naffection for her made me sometimes unjust to and\r\nnegligent of others; and I can acknowledge, more\r\nthan as a general principle, the justice of the\r\nHand which has struck this blow.\nYou know me too well to be at all afraid that I\r\nshould suffer materially from my feelings; I am\r\nperfectly conscious of the extent of my irreparable\r\nloss, but I am not at all overpowered and very little\r\nindisposed,\xe2\x80\x94nothing but what a short time,\r\nwith rest and change of air, will remove. I thank\r\nGod that I was enabled to attend her to the last,\r\nand amongst my many causes of self-reproach I\r\nhave not to add any wilful neglect of her comfort.\nShe felt herself to be dying about half an hour\r\nbefore she became tranquil and apparently unconscious.\r\nDuring that half-hour was her struggle,\r\npoor soul! She said she could not tell us what she\r\nsuffered, though she complained of little fixed\r\npain. When I asked her if there was anything\r\nshe wanted, her answer was she wanted nothing\r\nbut death, and some of her words were: "God\r\ngrant me patience, pray for me, oh, pray for me!"\r\nHer voice was affected, but as long as she spoke\r\nshe was intelligible.\nI hope I do not break your heart, my dearest\r\nFanny, by these particulars; I mean to afford you\r\ngratification whilst I am relieving my own feelings.\r\nI could not write so to anybody else; indeed you\r\nare the only person I have written to at all, excepting\r\nyour grandmamma,\xe2\x80\x94it was to her, not your\r\nUncle Charles, I wrote on Friday.\nImmediately after dinner on Thursday I went\r\ninto the town to do an errand which your dear\r\naunt was anxious about. I returned about a quarter\r\nbefore six, and found her recovering from faintness\r\nand oppression; she got so well as to be able\r\nto give me a minute account of her seizure, and\r\nwhen the clock struck six she was talking quietly\r\nto me.\nI cannot say how soon afterwards she was seized\r\nagain with the same faintness, which was followed\r\nby the sufferings she could not describe; but Mr.\r\nLyford had been sent for, had applied something\r\nto give her ease, and she was in a state of quiet\r\ninsensibility by seven o\'clock at the latest. From\r\nthat time till half-past four, when she ceased to\r\nbreathe, she scarcely moved a limb, so that we have\r\nevery reason to think, with gratitude to the Almighty,\r\nthat her sufferings were over. A slight\r\nmotion of the head with every breath remained till\r\nalmost the last. I sat close to her with a pillow\r\nin my lap to assist in supporting her head, which\r\nwas almost off the bed, for six hours; fatigue made\r\nme then resign my place to Mrs. J. A. for two\r\nhours and a half, when I took it again, and in about\r\nan hour more she breathed her last.\nI was able to close her eyes myself, and it was\r\na great gratification to me to render her those last\r\nservices. There was nothing convulsed which\r\ngave the idea of pain in her look; on the contrary,\r\nbut for the continual motion of the head\r\nshe gave one the idea of a beautiful statue, and\r\neven now, in her coffin, there is such a sweet,\r\nserene air over her countenance as is quite pleasant\r\nto contemplate.\nThis day, my dearest Fanny, you have had the\r\nmelancholy intelligence, and I know you suffer\r\nseverely, but I likewise know that you will apply\r\nto the fountain-head for consolation, and that our\r\nmerciful God is never deaf to such prayers as you\r\nwill offer.\nThe last sad ceremony is to take place on Thursday\r\nmorning; her dear remains are to be deposited\r\nin the cathedral. It is a satisfaction to me to\r\nthink that they are to lie in a building she admired\r\nso much; her precious soul, I presume to hope,\r\nreposes in a far superior mansion. May mine one\r\nday be reunited to it!\nYour dear papa, your Uncle Henry, and Frank\r\nand Edwd. Austen, instead of his father, will\r\nattend. I hope they will none of them suffer lastingly\r\nfrom their pious exertions. The ceremony\r\nmust be over before ten o\'clock, as the cathedral\r\nservice begins at that hour, so that we shall be at\r\nhome early in the day, for there will be nothing to\r\nkeep us here afterwards.\nYour Uncle James came to us yesterday, and is\r\ngone home to-day. Uncle H. goes to Chawton to-morrow\r\nmorning; he has given every necessary\r\ndirection here, and I think his company there will\r\ndo good. He returns to us again on Tuesday\r\nevening.\nI did not think to have written a long letter\r\nwhen I began, but I have found the employment\r\ndraw me on, and I hope I shall have been giving\r\nyou more pleasure than pain. Remember me\r\nkindly to Mrs. J. Bridges (I am so glad she is with\r\nyou now), and give my best love to Lizzie and all\r\nthe others.\nMy dearest Fanny,\xe2\x80\x94I have just read your\r\nletter for the third time, and thank you most sincerely\r\nfor every kind expression to myself, and\r\nstill more warmly for your praises of her who I\r\nbelieve was better known to you than to any human\r\nbeing besides myself. Nothing of the sort could\r\nhave been more gratifying to me than the manner\r\nin which you write of her; and if the dear angel is\r\nconscious of what passes here, and is not above all\r\nearthly feelings, she may perhaps receive pleasure\r\nin being so mourned. Had she been the survivor,\r\nI can fancy her speaking of you in almost the same\r\nterms. There are certainly many points of strong\r\nresemblance in your characters; in your intimate\r\nacquaintance with each other, and your mutual\r\nstrong affection, you were counterparts.\nThursday was not so dreadful a day to me as\r\nyou imagined. There was so much necessary to be\r\ndone that there was no time for additional misery.\r\nEverything was conducted with the greatest tranquillity,\r\nand but that I was determined I would\r\nsee the last, and therefore was upon the listen, I\r\nshould not have known when they left the house.\r\nI watched the little mournful procession the length\r\nof the street; and when it turned from my sight,\r\nand I had lost her forever, even then I was not\r\noverpowered, nor so much agitated as I am now in\r\nwriting of it. Never was human being more sincerely\r\nmourned by those who attended her remains\r\nthan was this dear creature. May the sorrow with\r\nwhich she is parted with on earth be a prognostic\r\nof the joy with which she is hailed in heaven!\nI continue very tolerably well,\xe2\x80\x94much better\r\nthan any one could have supposed possible, because\r\nI certainly have had considerable fatigue of body\r\nas well as anguish of mind for months back; but\r\nI really am well, and I hope I am properly grateful\r\nto the Almighty for having been so supported.\r\nYour grandmamma, too, is much better than when\r\nI came home.\nI did not think your dear papa appeared unwell,\r\nand I understand that he seemed much more comfortable\r\nafter his return from Winchester than he\r\nhad done before. I need not tell you that he was\r\na great comfort to me; indeed, I can never say\r\nenough of the kindness I have received from him\r\nand from every other friend.\nI get out of doors a good deal, and am able to\r\nemploy myself. Of course those employments suit\r\nme best which leave me most at leisure to think of\r\nher I have lost, and I do think of her in every\r\nvariety of circumstance,\xe2\x80\x94in our happy hours of\r\nconfidential intercourse, in the cheerful family\r\nparty which she so ornamented, in her sick-room,\r\non her death-bed, and as (I hope) an inhabitant of\r\nheaven. Oh, if I may one day be reunited to her\r\nthere! I know the time must come when my mind\r\nwill be less engrossed by her idea, but I do not\r\nlike to think of it. If I think of her less as on\r\nearth, God grant that I may never cease to reflect\r\non her as inhabiting heaven, and never cease my\r\nhumble endeavors (when it shall please God) to\r\njoin her there.\nIn looking at a few of the precious papers which\r\nare now my property I have found some memorandums,\r\namongst which she desires that one of\r\nher gold chains may be given to her god-daughter\r\nLouisa, and a lock of her hair be set for you. You\r\ncan need no assurance, my dearest Fanny, that\r\nevery request of your beloved aunt will be sacred\r\nwith me. Be so good as to say whether you prefer\r\na brooch or ring. God bless you, my dearest\r\nFanny.\n'
