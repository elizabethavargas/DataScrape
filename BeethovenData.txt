b'ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE,--\nMusic from my fourth year has ever been my\r\nfavorite pursuit. Thus early introduced to\r\nthe sweet Muse, who attuned my soul to pure harmony,\r\nI loved her, and sometimes ventured to\r\nthink that I was beloved by her in return. I have\r\nnow attained my eleventh year, and my Muse often\r\nwhispered to me in hours of inspiration,--Try to\r\nwrite down the harmonies in your soul. Only\r\neleven years old! thought I; does the character of\r\nan author befit me? and what would more mature\r\nartists say? I felt some trepidation; but my Muse\r\nwilled it--so I obeyed, and wrote.\nMay I now, therefore, Illustrious Prince, presume\r\nto lay the first-fruits of my juvenile labors at the\r\nfoot of your throne? and may I hope that you will\r\ncondescend to cast an encouraging and kindly\r\nglance on them? You will; for Art and Science\r\nhave ever found in you a judicious protector and a\r\ngenerous patron, and rising talent has always prospered\r\nunder your fostering and fatherly care. Encouraged\r\nby this cheering conviction, I venture to\r\napproach you with these my youthful efforts. Accept\r\nthem as the pure offering of childlike reverence,\r\nand graciously vouchsafe to regard with indulgence\r\nthem and their youthful composer,\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nBonn, 1787. Autumn.\nMY MOST ESTEEMED FRIEND,--\nI can easily imagine what you must think of me,\r\nand I cannot deny that you have too good grounds\r\nfor an unfavorable opinion. I shall not, however,\r\nattempt to justify myself, until I have explained to\r\nyou the reasons why my apologies should be accepted.\r\nI must tell you that from the time I left\r\nAugsburg[1] my cheerfulness, as well as my health,\r\nbegan to decline; the nearer I came to my native\r\ncity, the more frequent were the letters from my\r\nfather, urging me to travel with all possible speed,\r\nas my mother\'s health was in a most precarious condition.\r\nI therefore hurried forwards as fast as I could,\r\nalthough myself far from well. My longing once\r\nmore to see my dying mother overcame every obstacle,\r\nand assisted me in surmounting the greatest\r\ndifficulties. I found my mother indeed still alive,\r\nbut in the most deplorable state; her disease was\r\nconsumption, and about seven weeks ago, after\r\nmuch pain and suffering, she died [July 17]. She\r\nwas indeed a kind, loving mother to me, and my\r\nbest friend. Ah! who was happier than I, when I\r\ncould still utter the sweet name of mother, and it\r\nwas heard? But to whom can I now say it?\r\nOnly to the silent form resembling her, evoked by\r\nthe power of imagination. I have passed very few\r\npleasant hours since my arrival here, having during\r\nthe whole time been suffering from asthma, which\r\nmay, I fear, eventually turn to consumption; to this\r\nis added melancholy,--almost as great an evil as\r\nmy malady itself. Imagine yourself in my place,\r\nand then I shall hope to receive your forgiveness for\r\nmy long silence. You showed me extreme kindness\r\nand friendship by lending me three Carolins in\r\nAugsburg, but I must entreat your indulgence for\r\na time. My journey cost me a great deal, and I\r\nhave not the smallest hopes of earning anything\r\nhere. Fate is not propitious to me in Bonn. Pardon\r\nmy intruding on you so long with my affairs,\r\nbut all that I have said was necessary for my own\r\njustification.\nI do entreat you not to deprive me of your valuable\r\nfriendship; nothing do I wish so much as in\r\nany degree to become worthy of your regard. I\r\nam, with all esteem, your obedient servant and\r\nfriend,\nL. V. BEETHOVEN,\nCologne Court Organist.\n1793.\nMOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND GRACIOUS PRINCE,--\nSome years ago your Highness was pleased to\r\ngrant a pension to my father, the Court tenor Van\r\nBeethoven, and further graciously to decree that\r\n100 R. Thalers of his salary should be allotted to\r\nme, for the purpose of maintaining, clothing, and\r\neducating my two younger brothers, and also defraying\r\nthe debts incurred by our father. It was my\r\nintention to present this decree to your Highness\'s\r\ntreasurer, but my father earnestly implored me to\r\ndesist from doing so, that he might not be thus publicly\r\nproclaimed incapable himself of supporting his\r\nfamily, adding that he would engage to pay me the\r\n25 R.T. quarterly, which he punctually did. After\r\nhis death, however (in December last), wishing to\r\nreap the benefit of your Highness\'s gracious boon,\r\nby presenting the decree, I was startled to find that\r\nmy father had destroyed it.\nI therefore, with all dutiful respect, entreat your\r\nHighness to renew this decree, and to order the\r\npaymaster of your Highness\'s treasury to grant me\r\nthe last quarter of this benevolent addition to my\r\nsalary (due the beginning of February). I have\r\nthe honor to remain,\nYour Highness\'s most obedient and faithful servant,\nLUD. V. BEETHOVEN,\nCourt Organist.\nVienna, Nov. 2, 1793.\nMY HIGHLY ESTEEMED ELEONORE, MY DEAREST FRIEND,--\nA year of my stay in this capital has nearly\r\nelapsed before you receive a letter from me, and\r\nyet the most vivid remembrance of you is ever\r\npresent with me. I have often conversed in thought\r\nwith you and your dear family, though not always\r\nin the happy mood I could have wished, for that\r\nfatal misunderstanding still hovered before me, and\r\nmy conduct at that time is now hateful in my sight.\r\nBut so it was, and how much would I give to have\r\nthe power wholly to obliterate from my life a mode\r\nof acting so degrading to myself, and so contrary to\r\nthe usual tenor of my character!\nMany circumstances, indeed, contributed to estrange\r\nus, and I suspect that those tale-bearers who\r\nrepeated alternately to you and to me our mutual\r\nexpressions were the chief obstacles to any good\r\nunderstanding between us. Each believed that\r\nwhat was said proceeded from deliberate conviction,\r\nwhereas it arose only from anger, fanned by others;\r\nso we were both mistaken. Your good and noble\r\ndisposition, my dear friend, is sufficient security\r\nthat you have long since forgiven me. We are\r\ntold that the best proof of sincere contrition is to\r\nacknowledge our faults; and this is what I wish to\r\ndo. Let us now draw a veil over the whole affair,\r\nlearning one lesson from it,--that when friends\r\nare at variance, it is always better to employ no\r\nmediator, but to communicate directly with each\r\nother.\nWith this you will receive a dedication from me\r\n[the variations on "Se vuol ballare"]. My sole\r\nwish is that the work were greater and more\r\nworthy of you. I was applied to here to publish\r\nthis little work, and I take advantage of the opportunity,\r\nmy beloved Eleonore, to give you a proof\r\nof my regard and friendship for yourself, and also\r\na token of my enduring remembrance of your family.\r\nPray then accept this trifle, and do not forget\r\nthat it is offered by a devoted friend. Oh! if it\r\nonly gives you pleasure, my wishes will be fulfilled.\r\nMay it in some degree recall the time when I passed\r\nso many happy hours in your house! Perhaps it\r\nmay serve to remind you of me till I return, though\r\nthis is indeed a distant prospect. Oh! how we\r\nshall then rejoice together, my dear Eleonore!\r\nYou will, I trust, find your friend a happier man,\r\nall former forbidding, careworn furrows smoothed\r\naway by time and better fortune.\nWhen you see B. Koch [subsequently Countess\r\nBelderbusch], pray say that it is unkind in her\r\nnever once to have written to me. I wrote to her\r\ntwice, and three times to Malchus (afterwards\r\nWestphalian Minister of Finance), but no answer.\r\nTell her that if she does not choose to write herself,\r\nI beg that she will at least urge Malchus to do\r\nso. At the close of my letter I venture to make\r\none more request--I am anxious to be so fortunate\r\nas again to possess an Angola waistcoat knitted by\r\nyour own hand, my dear friend. Forgive my indiscreet\r\nrequest; it proceeds from my great love for\r\nall that comes from you; and I may privately admit\r\nthat a little vanity is connected with it, namely,\r\nthat I may say I possess something from the best\r\nand most admired young lady in Bonn. I still\r\nhave the one you were so good as to give me in\r\nBonn; but change of fashion has made it look so\r\nantiquated, that I can only treasure it in my wardrobe\r\nas your gift, and thus still very dear to me.\r\nYou would make me very happy by soon writing\r\nme a kind letter. If mine cause you any pleasure,\r\nI promise you to do as you wish, and write as often\r\nas it lies in my power; indeed everything is acceptable\r\nto me that can serve to show you how truly I\r\nam your admiring and sincere friend,\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nP.S. The variations are rather difficult to play,\r\nespecially the shake in the Coda; but do not be\r\nalarmed at this, being so contrived that you only\r\nrequire to play the shake, and leave out the other\r\nnotes, which also occur in the violin part. I never\r\nwould have written it in this way, had I not occasionally\r\nobserved that there was a certain individual\r\nin Vienna who, when I extemporized the previous\r\nevening, not unfrequently wrote down next\r\nday many of the peculiarities of my music, adopting\r\nthem as his own [for instance, the Abb\xc3\xa9 Gelinek].\r\nConcluding, therefore, that some of these\r\nthings would soon appear, I resolved to anticipate\r\nthis. Another reason also was to puzzle some of\r\nthe pianoforte teachers here, many of whom are my\r\nmortal foes; so I wished to revenge myself on them\r\nin this way, knowing that they would occasionally\r\nbe asked to play the variations, when these gentlemen\r\nwould not appear to much advantage.\nBEETHOVEN.\nThe beautiful neckcloth, embroidered by your\r\nown hand, was the greatest possible surprise to me;\r\nyet, welcome as the gift was, it awakened within\r\nme feelings of sadness. Its effect was to recall\r\nformer days, and to put me to shame by your noble\r\nconduct to me. I, indeed, little thought that you\r\nstill considered me worthy of your remembrance.\nOh! if you could have witnessed my emotions\r\nyesterday when this incident occurred, you would\r\nnot think that I exaggerate in saying that such a\r\ntoken of your recollection brought tears to my\r\neyes, and made me feel very sad. Little as I may\r\ndeserve favor in your eyes, believe me, my dear\r\nfriend, (let me still call you so,) I have suffered,\r\nand still suffer severely from the privation of your\r\nfriendship. Never can I forget you and your dear\r\nmother. You were so kind to me that your loss\r\nneither can nor will be easily replaced. I know\r\nwhat I have forfeited, and what you were to me,\r\nbut in order to fill up this blank I must recur to\r\nscenes equally painful for you to hear and for me to\r\ndetail.\nAs a slight requital of your kind souvenir, I take\r\nthe liberty to send you some variations, and a Rondo\r\nwith violin accompaniment. I have a great deal\r\nto do, or I would long since have transcribed the\r\nSonata I promised you. It is as yet a mere sketch\r\nin manuscript, and to copy it would be a difficult\r\ntask even for the clever and practised Paraquin\r\n[counter-bass in the Electoral orchestra]. You\r\ncan have the Rondo copied, and return the score.\r\nWhat I now send is the only one of my works at\r\nall suitable for you; besides, as you are going to\r\nKerpen [where an uncle of the family lived], I\r\nthought these trifles might cause you pleasure.\nFarewell, my friend; for it is impossible for me\r\nto give you any other name. However indifferent\r\nI may be to you, believe me, I shall ever continue\r\nto revere you and your mother as I have always\r\ndone. If I can in any way contribute to the fulfilment\r\nof a wish of yours, do not fail to let me\r\nknow, for I have no other means of testifying my\r\ngratitude for past friendship.\nI wish you an agreeable journey, and that your\r\ndear mother may return entirely restored to health!\r\nThink sometimes of your affectionate friend,\nBEETHOVEN.\nJune, 1794.\nDEAR SCHENK,[1]--\nI did not know that I was to set off to-day to\r\nEisenstadt. I should like to have talked to you\r\nagain. In the mean time rest assured of my gratitude\r\nfor your obliging services. I shall endeavor,\r\nso far as it lies in my power, to requite them. I\r\nhope soon to see you, and once more to enjoy the\r\npleasure of your society. Farewell, and do not\r\nentirely forget your\nBEETHOVEN.\n... In what an odious light have you exhibited\r\nme to myself! Oh! I acknowledge it, I do not\r\ndeserve your friendship. It was no intentional or\r\ndeliberate malice that induced me to act towards\r\nyou as I did, but inexcusable thoughtlessness\r\nalone.\nI say no more. I am coming to throw myself\r\ninto your arms, and to entreat you to restore me\r\nmy lost friend; and you will give him back to me,\r\nto your penitent, loving, and ever-grateful\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, May 1797.\nGod speed you, my dear friend! I owe you a\r\nletter which you shall shortly have, and my newest\r\nmusic besides, I am going on well; indeed, I may\r\nsay every day better. Greet those to whom it will\r\ngive pleasure from me. Farewell, and do not forget\r\nyour\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Oct. 1, 1797.\n\r\nTruth for the wise,\r\nBeauty for a feeling heart,\r\nAnd both for each other.\r\n\nMY DEAR, GOOD BREUNING,--\nNever can I forget the time I passed with you,\r\nnot only in Bonn, but here. Continue your friendship\r\ntowards me, for you shall always find me the\r\nsame true friend,\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\n1800.[1]\n\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\n\n\n\n\nMY CHEAPEST (NOT DEAREST) BARON,--\nDesire the guitar-player to come to me to-day.\r\nAmenda (instead of an amende [fine], which he\r\nsometimes deserves for not observing his rests properly)\r\nmust persuade this popular guitarist to visit\r\nme, and if possible to come at five o\'clock this\r\nevening; if not then, at five or six o\'clock to-morrow\r\nmorning; but he must not waken me if I chance to\r\nbe still asleep. Adieu, mon ami \xc3\xa0 bon march\xc3\xa9.\r\nPerhaps we may meet at the "Swan"?\nThe musical Count is from this day forth\r\ncashiered with infamy. The first violin [Schuppanzigh]\r\nruthlessly transported to Siberia. The Baron [see\r\nNo. 10] for a whole month strictly interdicted from\r\nasking questions; no longer to be so hasty, and to\r\ndevote himself exclusively to his ipse miserum.[1]\nB.\nDoes Amenda think that I can ever forget him,\r\nbecause I do not write? in fact, never have written\r\nto him?--as if the memory of our friends could\r\nonly thus be preserved! The best man I ever knew\r\nhas a thousand times recurred to my thoughts!\r\nTwo persons alone once possessed my whole love,\r\none of whom still lives, and you are now the third.\r\nHow can my remembrance of you ever fade? You\r\nwill shortly receive a long letter about my present\r\ncircumstances and all that can interest you. Farewell,\r\nbeloved, good, and noble friend! Ever continue\r\nyour love and friendship towards me, just as\r\nI shall ever be your faithful\nBEETHOVEN.\n1800.\nMY DEAR, MY GOOD AMENDA, MY WARM-HEARTED FRIEND,--\nI received and read your last letter with deep\r\nemotion, and with mingled pain and pleasure. To\r\nwhat can I compare your fidelity and devotion to\r\nme? Ah! it is indeed delightful that you still continue\r\nto love me so well. I know how to prize you,\r\nand to distinguish you from all others; you are not\r\nlike my Vienna friends. No! you are one of those\r\nwhom the soil of my fatherland is wont to bring\r\nforth; how often I wish that you were with me,\r\nfor your Beethoven is very unhappy. You must\r\nknow that one of my most precious faculties, that\r\nof hearing, is become very defective; even while\r\nyou were still with me I felt indications of this,\r\nthough I said nothing; but it is now much worse.\r\nWhether I shall ever be cured remains yet to be\r\nseen; it is supposed to proceed from the state of\r\nmy digestive organs, but I am almost entirely recovered\r\nin that respect. I hope indeed that my\r\nhearing may improve, but I scarcely think so, for\r\nattacks of this kind are the most incurable of all.\r\nHow sad my life must now be!--forced to shun\r\nall that is most dear and precious to me, and to live\r\nwith such miserable egotists as ----, &c. I can\r\nwith truth say that of all my friends Lichnowsky\r\n[Prince Carl] is the most genuine. He last year\r\nsettled 600 florins on me, which, together with\r\nthe good sale of my works, enables me to live\r\nfree from care as to my maintenance. All that I\r\nnow write I can dispose of five times over, and be\r\nwell paid into the bargain. I have been writing a\r\ngood deal latterly, and as I hear that you have ordered\r\nsome pianos from ----, I will send you some\r\nof my compositions in the packing-case of one of\r\nthese instruments, by which means they will not\r\ncost you so much.\nTo my great comfort, a person has returned\r\nhere with whom I can enjoy the pleasures of society\r\nand disinterested friendship,--one of the friends\r\nof my youth [Stephan von Breuning]. I have\r\noften spoken to him of you, and told him that since\r\nI left my fatherland, you are one of those to whom\r\nmy heart specially clings. Z. [Zmeskall?] does\r\nnot seem quite to please him; he is, and always\r\nwill be, too weak for true friendship, and I look on\r\nhim and ---- as mere instruments on which I play\r\nas I please, but never can they bear noble testimony\r\nto my inner and outward energies, or feel true\r\nsympathy with me; I value them only in so far as\r\ntheir services deserve. Oh! how happy should I\r\nnow be, had I my full sense of hearing; I would\r\nthen hasten to you; whereas, as it is, I must withdraw\r\nfrom everything. My best years will thus\r\npass away, without effecting what my talents and\r\npowers might have enabled me to perform. How\r\nmelancholy is the resignation in which I must take\r\nrefuge! I had determined to rise superior to all\r\nthis, but how is it possible? If in the course of\r\nsix months my malady be pronounced incurable\r\nthen, Amenda! I shall appeal to you to leave all\r\nelse and come to me, when I intend to travel (my\r\naffliction is less distressing when playing and composing,\r\nand most so in intercourse with others),\r\nand you must be my companion. I have a conviction\r\nthat good fortune will not forsake me, for to\r\nwhat may I not at present aspire? Since you were\r\nhere I have written everything except operas and\r\nchurch music. You will not, I know, refuse my\r\npetition; you will help your friend to bear his burden\r\nand his calamity. I have also very much perfected\r\nmy pianoforte playing, and I hope that a\r\njourney of this kind may possibly contribute to your\r\nown success in life, and you would thenceforth always\r\nremain with me. I duly received all your\r\nletters, and though I did not reply to them, you\r\nwere constantly present with me, and my heart\r\nbeats as tenderly as ever for you. I beg you will\r\nkeep the fact of my deafness a profound secret, and\r\nnot confide it to any human being. Write to me\r\nfrequently; your letters, however short, console and\r\ncheer me; so I shall soon hope to hear from you.\nDo not give your quartet to any one [in F, Op.\r\n18, No. 1], as I have altered it very much, having\r\nonly now succeeded in writing quartets properly;\r\nthis you will at once perceive when you receive it.\r\nNow, farewell, my dear kind friend! If by any\r\nchance I can serve you here, I need not say that\r\nyou have only to command me.\nYour faithful and truly attached\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, June 29, 1800.\nMY DEAR AND VALUED WEGELER,--\nHow much I thank you for your remembrance of\r\nme, little as I deserve it, or have sought to deserve\r\nit; and yet you are so kind that you allow nothing,\r\nnot even my unpardonable neglect, to discourage\r\nyou, always remaining the same true, good, and faithful\r\nfriend. That I can ever forget you or yours,\r\nonce so dear and precious to me, do not for a moment\r\nbelieve. There are times when I find myself\r\nlonging to see you again, and wishing that I could\r\ngo to stay with you. My father-land, that lovely\r\nregion where I first saw the light, is still as distinct\r\nand beauteous in my eyes as when I quitted you;\r\nin short, I shall esteem the time when I once more\r\nsee you, and again greet Father Rhine, as one of\r\nthe happiest periods of my life. When this may be\r\nI cannot yet tell; but at all events I may say that\r\nyou shall not see me again till I have become eminent,\r\nnot only as an artist, but better and more\r\nperfect as a man; and if the condition of our father-land\r\nbe then more prosperous, my art shall be\r\nentirely devoted to the benefit of the poor. Oh,\r\nblissful moment!--how happy do I esteem myself\r\nthat I can expedite it and bring it to pass!\nYou desire to know something of my position;\r\nwell! it is by no means bad. However incredible\r\nit may appear, I must tell you that Lichnowsky has\r\nbeen, and still is, my warmest friend (slight dissensions\r\noccurred occasionally between us, and yet they\r\nonly served to strengthen our friendship). He\r\nsettled on me last year the sum of 600 florins, for\r\nwhich I am to draw on him till I can procure some\r\nsuitable situation. My compositions are very profitable,\r\nand I may really say that I have almost more\r\ncommissions than it is possible for me to execute.\r\nI can have six or seven publishers or more for every\r\npiece, if I choose; they no longer bargain with me--I\r\ndemand, and they pay--so you see this is a\r\nvery good thing. For instance, I have a friend in\r\ndistress, and my purse does not admit of my assisting\r\nhim at once; but I have only to sit down and\r\nwrite, and in a short time he is relieved. I am also\r\nbecome more economical than formerly. If I finally\r\nsettle here, I don\'t doubt I shall be able to secure a\r\nparticular day every year for a concert, of which I\r\nhave already given several. That malicious demon,\r\nhowever, bad health, has been a stumbling-block in\r\nmy path; my hearing during the last three years has\r\nbecome gradually worse. The chief cause of this\r\ninfirmity proceeds from the state of my digestive\r\norgans, which, as you know, were formerly bad\r\nenough, but have latterly become much worse, and\r\nbeing constantly afflicted with diarrhoea, has brought\r\non extreme weakness. Frank [Director of the\r\nGeneral Hospital] strove to restore the tone of my\r\ndigestion by tonics, and my hearing by oil of almonds;\r\nbut alas! these did me no good whatever;\r\nmy hearing became worse, and my digestion continued\r\nin its former plight. This went on till the\r\nautumn of last year, when I was often reduced to\r\nutter despair. Then some medical asinus recommended\r\nme cold baths, but a more judicious doctor\r\nthe tepid ones of the Danube, which did wonders\r\nfor me; my digestion improved, but my hearing\r\nremained the same, or in fact rather got worse. I\r\ndid indeed pass a miserable winter; I suffered from\r\nmost dreadful spasms, and sank back into my former\r\ncondition. Thus it went on till about a month\r\nago, when I consulted Vering [an army surgeon],\r\nunder the belief that my maladies required surgical\r\nadvice; besides, I had every confidence in him.\r\nHe succeeded in almost entirely checking the violent\r\ndiarrhoea, and ordered me the tepid baths of\r\nthe Danube, into which I pour some strengthening\r\nmixture. He gave me no medicine, except some\r\ndigestive pills four days ago, and a lotion for my\r\nears. I certainly do feel better and stronger, but\r\nmy ears are buzzing and ringing perpetually, day\r\nand night. I can with truth say that my life is very\r\nwretched; for nearly two years past I have avoided\r\nall society, because I find it impossible to say to people,\r\nI am deaf! In any other profession this might\r\nbe more tolerable, but in mine such a condition is\r\ntruly frightful. Besides, what would my enemies\r\nsay to this?--and they are not few in number.\nTo give you some idea of my extraordinary deafness,\r\nI must tell you that in the theatre I am\r\nobliged to lean close up against the orchestra in order\r\nto understand the actors, and when a little way\r\noff I hear none of the high notes of instruments or\r\nsingers. It is most astonishing that in conversation\r\nsome people never seem to observe this; being subject\r\nto fits of absence, they attribute it to that\r\ncause. I often can scarcely hear a person if\r\nspeaking low; I can distinguish the tones, but not\r\nthe words, and yet I feel it intolerable if any one\r\nshouts to me. Heaven alone knows how it is to\r\nend! Vering declares that I shall certainly improve,\r\neven if I be not entirely restored. How\r\noften have I cursed my existence! Plutarch led\r\nme to resignation. I shall strive if possible to set\r\nFate at defiance, although there must be moments\r\nin my life when I cannot fail to be the most unhappy\r\nof God\'s creatures. I entreat you to say\r\nnothing of my affliction to any one, not even to\r\nLorchen [see Nos. 4 and 5]. I confide the secret\r\nto you alone, and entreat you some day to correspond\r\nwith Vering on the subject. If I continue\r\nin the same state, I shall come to you in the ensuing\r\nspring, when you must engage a house for me\r\nsomewhere in the country, amid beautiful scenery,\r\nand I shall then become a rustic for a year, which\r\nmay perhaps effect a change. Resignation!--what\r\na miserable refuge! and yet it is my sole remaining\r\none. You will forgive my thus appealing\r\nto your kindly sympathies at a time when your own\r\nposition is sad enough. Stephan Breuning is here,\r\nand we are together almost every day; it does me\r\nso much good to revive old feelings! He has\r\nreally become a capital good fellow, not devoid of\r\ntalent, and his heart, like that of us all, pretty\r\nmuch in the right place. [See No. 13.]\nI have very charming rooms at present, adjoining\r\nthe Bastei [the ramparts], and peculiarly valuable\r\nto me on account of my health [at Baron Pasqualati\'s].\r\nI do really think I shall be able to arrange\r\nthat Breuning shall come to me. You shall have\r\nyour Antiochus [a picture], and plenty of my\r\nmusic besides--if, indeed, it will not cost you too\r\nmuch. Your love of art does honestly rejoice me.\r\nOnly say how it is to be done, and I will send you\r\nall my works, which now amount to a considerable\r\nnumber, and are daily increasing. I beg you will\r\nlet me have my grandfather\'s portrait as soon as\r\npossible by the post, in return for which I send you\r\nthat of his grandson, your loving and attached\r\nBeethoven. It has been brought out here by\r\nArtaria, who, as well as many other publishers, has\r\noften urged this on me. I intend soon to write to\r\nStoffeln [Christoph von Breuning], and plainly admonish\r\nhim about his surly humor. I mean to\r\nsound in his ears our old friendship, and to insist on\r\nhis promising me not to annoy you further in your\r\nsad circumstances. I will also write to the amiable\r\nLorchen. Never have I forgotten one of you, my\r\nkind friends, though you did not hear from me;\r\nbut you know well that writing never was my forte,\r\neven my best friends having received no letters\r\nfrom me for years. I live wholly in my music, and\r\nscarcely is one work finished when another is begun;\r\nindeed, I am now often at work on three or four\r\nthings at the same time. Do write to me frequently,\r\nand I will strive to find time to write to\r\nyou also. Give my remembrances to all, especially\r\nto the kind Frau Hofr\xc3\xa4thin [von Breuning], and\r\nsay to her that I am still subject to an occasional\r\nraptus. As for K----, I am not at all surprised\r\nat the change in her: Fortune rolls like a ball, and\r\ndoes not always stop before the best and noblest.\r\nAs to Ries [Court musician in Bonn], to whom\r\npray cordially remember me, I must say one word.\r\nI will write to you more particularly about his son\r\n[Ferdinand], although I believe that he would be\r\nmore likely to succeed in Paris than in Vienna,\r\nwhich is already overstocked, and where even those\r\nof the highest merit find it a hard matter to maintain\r\nthemselves. By next autumn or winter, I\r\nshall be able to see what can be done for him,\r\nbecause then all the world returns to town. Farewell,\r\nmy kind, faithful Wegeler! Rest assured of\r\nthe love and friendship of your\nBEETHOVEN.\nMorning, July 6, 1800.\nMY ANGEL! MY ALL! MY SECOND SELF!\nOnly a few words to-day, written with a pencil\r\n(your own). My residence cannot be settled till\r\nto-morrow. What a tiresome loss of time! Why\r\nthis deep grief when necessity compels?--can our\r\nlove exist without sacrifices, and by refraining from\r\ndesiring all things? Can you alter the fact that\r\nyou are not wholly mine, nor I wholly yours? Ah!\r\ncontemplate the beauties of Nature, and reconcile\r\nyour spirit to the inevitable. Love demands all,\r\nand has a right to do so, and thus it is I feel towards\r\nyou and you towards me; but you do not sufficiently\r\nremember that I must live both for you and for myself.\r\nWere we wholly united, you would feel this\r\nsorrow as little as I should. My journey was terrible.\r\nI did not arrive here till four o\'clock yesterday\r\nmorning, as no horses were to be had. The\r\ndrivers chose another route; but what a dreadful\r\none it was! At the last stage I was warned not to\r\ntravel through the night, and to beware of a certain\r\nwood, but this only incited me to go forward, and I\r\nwas wrong. The carriage broke down, owing to\r\nthe execrable roads, mere deep rough country lanes,\r\nand had it not been for the postilions I must have\r\nbeen left by the wayside. Esterhazy, travelling\r\nthe usual road, had the same fate with eight horses,\r\nwhereas I had only four. Still I felt a certain\r\ndegree of pleasure, which I invariably do when I\r\nhave happily surmounted any difficulty. But I\r\nmust now pass from the outer to the inner man.\r\nWe shall, I trust, soon meet again; to-day I cannot\r\nimpart to you all the reflections I have made,\r\nduring the last few days, on my life; were our\r\nhearts closely united forever, none of these would\r\noccur to me. My heart is overflowing with all I\r\nhave to say to you. Ah! there are moments when\r\nI find that speech is actually nothing. Take courage!\r\nContinue to be ever my true and only love,\r\nmy all! as I am yours. The gods must ordain\r\nwhat is further to be and shall be!\nYour faithful\r\nLUDWIG.\nMonday Evening, July 6.\nYou grieve! dearest of all beings! I have just\r\nheard that the letters must be sent off very early.\r\nMondays and Thursdays are the only days when the\r\npost goes to K. from here. You grieve! Ah!\r\nwhere I am, there you are ever with me; how\r\nearnestly shall I strive to pass my life with you,\r\nand what a life will it be!!! Whereas now!!\r\nwithout you!! and persecuted by the kindness of\r\nothers, which I neither deserve nor try to deserve!\r\nThe servility of man towards his fellow-man pains\r\nme, and when I regard myself as a component part\r\nof the universe, what am I, what is he who is\r\ncalled the greatest?--and yet herein are displayed\r\nthe godlike feelings of humanity!--I weep in\r\nthinking that you will receive no intelligence from\r\nme till probably Saturday. However dearly you\r\nmay love me, I love you more fondly still. Never\r\nconceal your feelings from me. Good-night! As\r\na patient at these baths, I must now go to rest [a\r\nfew words are here effaced by Beethoven himself].\r\nOh, heavens! so near, and yet so far! Is not our\r\nlove a truly celestial mansion, but firm as the vault\r\nof heaven itself?\nJuly 7.\nGOOD-MORNING!\nEven before I rise, my thoughts throng to you,\r\nmy immortal beloved!--sometimes full of joy, and\r\nyet again sad, waiting to see whether Fate will hear\r\nus. I must live either wholly with you, or not\r\nat all. Indeed I have resolved to wander far from\r\nyou [see No. 13] till the moment arrives when I\r\ncan fly into your arms, and feel that they are my\r\nhome, and send forth my soul in unison with yours\r\ninto the realm of spirits. Alas! it must be so!\r\nYou will take courage, for you know my fidelity.\r\nNever can another possess my heart--never,\r\nnever! Oh, heavens! Why must I fly from her\r\nI so fondly love? and yet my existence in W. was\r\nas miserable as here. Your love made me the most\r\nhappy and yet the most unhappy of men. At my\r\nage, life requires a uniform equality; can this be\r\nfound in our mutual relations? My angel! I have\r\nthis moment heard that the post goes every day, so\r\nI must conclude, that you may get this letter the\r\nsooner. Be calm! for we can only attain our object\r\nof living together by the calm contemplation\r\nof our existence. Continue to love me. Yesterday,\r\nto-day, what longings for you, what tears for\r\nyou! for you! for you! my life! my all! Farewell!\r\nOh! love me forever, and never doubt the faithful\r\nheart of your lover, L.\n\r\nEver thine.\r\nEver mine.\r\nEver each other\'s.\r\n\nVienna, August 4, 1800.\nMOST ESTEEMED FRIEND,--\nYou will receive with this one of my compositions\r\npublished some years since, and yet, to my\r\nshame, you probably have never heard of it. I\r\ncannot attempt to excuse myself, or to explain why\r\nI dedicated a work to you which came direct from\r\nmy heart, but never acquainted you with its existence,\r\nunless indeed in this way, that at first I did\r\nnot know where you lived, and partly also from\r\ndiffidence, which led me to think I might have\r\nbeen premature in dedicating a work to you before\r\nascertaining that you approved of it. Indeed, even\r\nnow I send you "Adelaide" with a feeling of timidity.\r\nYou know yourself what changes the lapse\r\nof some years brings forth in an artist who continues\r\nto make progress; the greater the advances\r\nwe make in art, the less are we satisfied with our\r\nworks of an earlier date. My most ardent wish\r\nwill be fulfilled if you are not dissatisfied with the\r\nmanner in which I have set your heavenly "Adelaide"\r\nto music, and are incited by it soon to compose\r\na similar poem; and if you do not consider\r\nmy request too indiscreet, I would ask you to send\r\nit to me forthwith, that I may exert all my energies\r\nto approach your lovely poetry in merit. Pray\r\nregard the dedication as a token of the pleasure\r\nwhich your "Adelaide" conferred on me, as well as\r\nof the appreciation and intense delight your poetry\r\nalways has inspired, and always will inspire in me.\nWhen playing "Adelaide," sometimes recall\nYour sincere admirer,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nOctober, 1800.\nDEAR LADY,--\nAt the second announcement of our concert,\r\nyou must remind your husband that the public\r\nshould be made acquainted with the names of those\r\nwhose talents are to contribute to this concert.\r\nSuch is the custom here; and indeed, were it not\r\nso, what is there to attract a larger audience? which\r\nis after all our chief object. Punto [the celebrated\r\nhorn-player, for whom Beethoven wrote Sonata\r\n17] is not a little indignant about the omission,\r\nand I must say he has reason to be so; but even\r\nbefore seeing him it was my intention to have reminded\r\nyou of this, for I can only explain the mistake\r\nby great haste or great forgetfulness. Be so\r\ngood, then, dear lady, as to attend to my hint\r\notherwise you will certainly expose yourself to\r\nmany annoyances. Being at last convinced in my\r\nown mind, and by others, that I shall not be quite\r\nsuperfluous in this concert, I know that not only\r\nI, but also Punto, Simoni [a tenorist], and Galvani\r\nwill demand that the public should be apprised of\r\nour zeal for this charitable object; otherwise we\r\nmust all conclude that we are not wanted.\nYours,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Nov. 16, 1800.\nMY DEAR WEGELER,--\nI thank you for this fresh proof of your interest in\r\nme, especially as I so little deserve it. You wish\r\nto know how I am, and what remedies I use. Unwilling\r\nas I always feel to discuss this subject, still\r\nI feel less reluctant to do so with you than with any\r\nother person. For some months past Vering has\r\nordered me to apply blisters on both arms, of a particular\r\nkind of bark, with which you are probably\r\nacquainted,--a disagreeable remedy, independent\r\nof the pain, as it deprives me of the free use of my\r\narms for a couple of days at a time, till the blisters\r\nhave drawn sufficiently. The ringing and buzzing\r\nin my ears have certainly rather decreased, particularly\r\nin the left ear, in which the malady first commenced,\r\nbut my hearing is not at all improved; in\r\nfact I fear that it is become rather worse. My\r\nhealth is better, and after using the tepid baths for\r\na time, I feel pretty well for eight or ten days. I\r\nseldom take tonics, but I have begun applications of\r\nherbs, according to your advice. Vering will not\r\nhear of plunge baths, but I am much dissatisfied with\r\nhim; he is neither so attentive nor so indulgent\r\nas he ought to be to such a malady; if I did not\r\ngo to him, which is no easy matter, I should never\r\nsee him at all. What is your opinion of Schmidt\r\n[an army surgeon]? I am unwilling to make any\r\nchange, but it seems to me that Vering is too much\r\nof a practitioner to acquire new ideas by reading.\r\nOn this point Schmidt appears to be a very different\r\nman, and would probably be less negligent with\r\nregard to my case. I hear wonders of galvanism;\r\nwhat do you say to it? A physician told me that\r\nhe knew a deaf and dumb child whose hearing was\r\nrestored by it (in Berlin), and likewise a man who\r\nhad been deaf for seven years, and recovered his\r\nhearing. I am told that your friend Schmidt is at\r\nthis moment making experiments on the subject.\nI am now leading a somewhat more agreeable\r\nlife, as of late I have been associating more with\r\nother people. You could scarcely believe what a\r\nsad and dreary life mine has been for the last two\r\nyears; my defective hearing everywhere pursuing\r\nme like a spectre, making me fly from every one,\r\nand appear a misanthrope; and yet no one is in\r\nreality less so! This change has been wrought by\r\na lovely fascinating girl [undoubtedly Giulietta],\r\nwho loves me and whom I love. I have once more\r\nhad some blissful moments during the last two\r\nyears, and it is the first time I ever felt that marriage\r\ncould make me happy. Unluckily, she is not\r\nin my rank of life, and indeed at this moment I\r\ncan marry no one; I must first bestir myself actively\r\nin the world. Had it not been for my deafness,\r\nI would have travelled half round the globe\r\nere now, and this I must still do. For me there is\r\nno pleasure so great as to promote and to pursue\r\nmy art.\nDo not suppose that I could be happy with you.\r\nWhat indeed could make me happier? Your very\r\nsolicitude would distress me; I should read your\r\ncompassion every moment in your countenance,\r\nwhich would make me only still more unhappy.\r\nWhat were my thoughts amid the glorious scenery\r\nof my father-land? The hope alone of a happier\r\nfuture, which would have been mine but for this\r\naffliction! Oh! I could span the world were I only\r\nfree from this! I feel that my youth is only now\r\ncommencing. Have I not always been an infirm\r\ncreature? For some time past my bodily strength\r\nhas been increasing, and it is the same with my\r\nmental powers. I feel, though I cannot describe\r\nit, that I daily approach the object I have in view,\r\nin which alone can your Beethoven live. No rest\r\nfor him!--I know of none but in sleep, and I do\r\ngrudge being obliged to sacrifice more time to it\r\nthan formerly.[1] Were I only half cured of my\r\nmalady, then I would come to you, and, as a more\r\nperfect and mature man, renew our old friendship.\nYou should then see me as happy as I am ever\r\ndestined to be here below--not unhappy. No!\r\nthat I could not endure; I will boldly meet my\r\nfate, never shall it succeed in crushing me. Oh!\r\nit is so glorious to live one\'s life a thousand times\r\nover! I feel that I am no longer made for a quiet\r\nexistence. You will write to me as soon as possible?\r\nPray try to prevail on Steffen [von Breuning]\r\nto seek an appointment from the Teutonic\r\nOrder somewhere. Life here is too harassing for\r\nhis health; besides, he is so isolated that I do not\r\nsee how he is ever to get on. You know the kind\r\nof existence here. I do not take it upon myself to\r\nsay that society would dispel his lassitude, but he\r\ncannot be persuaded to go anywhere. A short\r\ntime since, I had some music in my house, but our\r\nfriend Steffen stayed away. Do recommend him\r\nto be more calm and self-possessed, which I have in\r\nvain tried to effect; otherwise he can neither enjoy\r\nhealth nor happiness. Tell me in your next\r\nletter whether you care about my sending you a\r\nlarge selection of music; you can indeed dispose\r\nof what you do not want, and thus repay the expense\r\nof the carriage, and have my portrait into the\r\nbargain. Say all that is kind and amiable from\r\nme to Lorchen, and also to mamma and Christoph.\r\nYou still have some regard for me? Always rely\r\non the love as well as the friendship of your\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Dec. 15, 1800.\nMY DEAR BROTHER IN ART,--\nI have often intended to answer your proposals,\r\nbut am frightfully lazy about all correspondence; so\r\nit is usually a good while before I can make up my\r\nmind to write dry letters instead of music. I have,\r\nhowever, at last forced myself to answer your application.\r\nPro primo, I must tell you how much I\r\nregret that you, my much-loved brother in the science\r\nof music, did not give me some hint, so that I\r\nmight have offered you my quartets, as well as\r\nmany other things that I have now disposed of.\r\nBut if you are as conscientious, my dear brother, as\r\nmany other publishers, who grind to death us poor\r\ncomposers, you will know pretty well how to derive\r\nample profit when the works appear. I now\r\nbriefly state what you can have from me. 1st. A\r\nSeptet, per il violino, viola, violoncello, contra-basso,\r\nclarinetto, corno, fagotto;--tutti obbligati (I can\r\nwrite nothing that is not obbligato, having come\r\ninto the world with an obbligato accompaniment!)\r\nThis Septet pleases very much. For more general\r\nuse it might be arranged for one more violino,\r\nviola, and violoncello, instead of the three wind-instruments,\r\nfagotto, clarinetto, and corno.[2] 2d. A\r\nGrand Symphony with full orchestra [the 1st].\r\n3rd. A pianoforte Concerto [Op. 19], which I by\r\nno means assert to be one of my best, any more\r\nthan the one Mollo is to publish here [Op. 15],\r\n(this is for the benefit of the Leipzig critics!) because\r\nI reserve the best for myself till I set off on\r\nmy travels; still the work will not disgrace you to\r\npublish. 4th. A Grand Solo Sonata [Op. 22].\r\nThese are all I can part with at this moment; a\r\nlittle later you can have a quintet for stringed instruments,\r\nand probably some quartets also, and\r\nother pieces that I have not at present beside me.\r\nIn your answer you can yourself fix the prices; and\r\nas you are neither an Italian nor a Jew, nor am I\r\neither, we shall no doubt quickly agree. Farewell,\r\nand rest assured,\nMy dear brother in art, of the esteem of your\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Jan. 15 (or thereabouts), 1801.\nI read your letter, dear brother and friend, with\r\nmuch pleasure, and I thank you for your good opinion\r\nof me and of my works, and hope I may continue\r\nto deserve it. I also beg you to present all\r\ndue thanks to Herr K. [K\xc3\xbchnel] for his politeness\r\nand friendship towards me. I, on my part, rejoice\r\nin your undertakings, and am glad that when works\r\nof art do turn out profitable, they fall to the share\r\nof true artists, rather than to that of mere tradesmen.\nYour intention to publish Sebastian Bach\'s works\r\nreally gladdens my heart, which beats with devotion\r\nfor the lofty and grand productions of this our\r\nfather of the science of harmony, and I trust I shall\r\nsoon see them appear. I hope when golden peace\r\nis proclaimed, and your subscription list opened, to\r\nprocure you many subscribers here.[1]\nWith regard to our own transactions, as you wish\r\nto know my proposals, they are as follows. I offer\r\nyou at present the following works:--The Septet\r\n(which I already wrote to you about), 20 ducats;\r\nSymphony, 20 ducats; Concerto, 10 ducats; Grand\r\nSolo Sonata, allegro, adagio, minuetto, rondo, 20\r\nducats. This Sonata [Op. 22] is well up to the\r\nmark, my dear brother!\nNow for explanations. You may perhaps be surprised\r\nthat I make no difference of price between the\r\nsonata, septet, and symphony. I do so because\r\nI find that a septet or a symphony has not so great\r\na sale as a sonata, though a symphony ought\r\nunquestionably to be of the most value. (N.B.\r\nThe septet consists of a short introductory adagio,\r\nan allegro, adagio, minuetto, andante, with variations,\r\nminuetto, and another short adagio preceding a\r\npresto.) I only ask ten ducats for the concerto,\r\nfor, as I already wrote to you, I do not consider it\r\none of my best. I cannot think that, taken as a\r\nwhole, you will consider these prices exorbitant; at\r\nleast, I have endeavored to make them as moderate\r\nas possible for you.\nWith regard to the banker\'s draft, as you give\r\nme my choice, I beg you will make it payable by\r\nGerm\xc3\xbcller or Sch\xc3\xbcller. The entire sum for the\r\nfour works will amount to 70 ducats; I understand\r\nno currency but Vienna ducats, so how many dollars\r\nin gold they make in your money is no affair\r\nof mine, for really I am a very bad man of business\r\nand accountant. Now this troublesome business is\r\nconcluded;--I call it so, heartily wishing that it\r\ncould be otherwise here below! There ought to\r\nbe only one grand d\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t of art in the world, to\r\nwhich the artist might repair with his works, and\r\non presenting them receive what he required; but\r\nas it now is, one must be half a tradesman besides--and\r\nhow is this to be endured? Good heavens!\r\nI may well call it troublesome!\nAs for the Leipzig oxen,[2] let them talk!--they\r\ncertainly will make no man immortal by their prating,\r\nand as little can they deprive of immortality\r\nthose whom Apollo destines to attain it.\nNow may Heaven preserve you and your colleagues!\r\nI have been unwell for some time; so it\r\nis rather difficult for me at present to write even\r\nmusic, much more letters. I trust we shall have\r\nfrequent opportunities to assure each other how\r\ntruly you are my friend, and I yours.\nI hope for a speedy answer. Adieu!\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, April 22, 1801.\nYou have indeed too good cause to complain not\r\na little of me. My excuse is that I have been ill,\r\nand in addition had so much to do, that I could\r\nscarcely even think of what I was to send you.\r\nMoreover, the only thing in me that resembles a\r\ngenius is, that my papers are never in very good\r\norder, and yet no one but myself can succeed in arranging\r\nthem. For instance, in the score of the\r\nconcerto, the piano part, according to my usual\r\ncustom, was not yet written down; so, owing to my\r\nhurry, you will receive it in my own very illegible\r\nwriting. In order that the works may follow as\r\nnearly as possible in their proper order, I have\r\nmarked the numbers to be placed on each, as follows:--\nVienna, June, 1801.\nI am rather surprised at the communication you\r\nhave desired your business agent here to make to\r\nme; I may well feel offended at your believing me\r\ncapable of so mean a trick. It would have been a\r\nvery different thing had I sold my works to rapacious\r\nshopkeepers, and then secretly made another\r\ngood speculation; but, from one artist to another,\r\nit is rather a strong measure to suspect me of such\r\na proceeding! The whole thing seems to be either\r\na device to put me to the test, or a mere suspicion.\r\nIn any event I may tell you that before you received\r\nthe septet from me I had sent it to Mr.\r\nSalomon in London (to be played at his own concert,\r\nwhich I did solely from friendship), with the\r\nexpress injunction to beware of its getting into\r\nother hands, as it was my intention to have it engraved\r\nin Germany, and, if you choose, you can\r\napply to him for the confirmation of this. But to\r\ngive you a further proof of my integrity, "I herewith\r\ngive you the faithful assurance that I have\r\nneither sold the septet, the symphony, the concerto,\r\nnor the sonata to any one but to Messrs.\r\nHofmeister and K\xc3\xbchnel, and that they may consider\r\nthem to be their own exclusive property.\r\nAnd to this I pledge my honor." You may make\r\nwhat use you please of this guarantee.\nMoreover, I believe Salomon to be as incapable\r\nof the baseness of engraving the septet as I am\r\nof selling it to him. I was so scrupulous in the\r\nmatter, that when applied to by various publishers\r\nto sanction a pianoforte arrangement of the septet,\r\nI at once declined, though I do not even know\r\nwhether you proposed making use of it in this way.\r\nHere follow the long-promised titles of the works.\r\nThere will no doubt be a good deal to alter and to\r\namend in them; but this I leave to you. I shall\r\nsoon expect a letter from you, and, I hope, the works\r\nlikewise, which I wish to see engraved, as others\r\nhave appeared, and are about to appear, in connection\r\nwith these numbers. I look on your statement\r\nas founded on mere rumors, which you have believed\r\nwith too much facility, or based entirely on\r\nsupposition, induced by having perchance heard\r\nthat I had sent the work to Salomon; I cannot,\r\ntherefore, but feel some coolness towards such a\r\ncredulous friend, though I still subscribe myself\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1801.\nMONSIEUR,--\nJe sens parfaitement bien, que la Celebrit\xc3\xa9 de\r\nVotre nom ainsi que l\'amiti\xc3\xa9 dont Vous m\'honorez,\r\nexigeroient de moi la d\xc3\xa9dicace d\'un bien plus important\r\nouvrage. La seule chose qui a pu me\r\nd\xc3\xa9terminer \xc3\xa0 Vous offrir celui-ci de pr\xc3\xa9f\xc3\xa9rence,\r\nc\'est qu\'il me paro\xc3\xaet d\'une ex\xc3\xa9cution plus facile et\r\npar la m\xc3\xaame plus propre \xc3\xa0 contribuer \xc3\xa0 la Satisfaction\r\ndont Vous jouissez dans l\'aimable Cercle de\r\nVotre Famille.--C\'est surtout, lorsque les heureux\r\ntalents d\'une fille ch\xc3\xa9rie se seront developp\xc3\xa9s davantage,\r\nque je me flatte de voir ce but atteint.\r\nHeureux si j\'y ai r\xc3\xa9ussi et si dans cette faible\r\nmarque de ma haute estime et de ma gratitude\r\nVous reconnoissez toute la vivacit\xc3\xa9 et la cordialit\xc3\xa9\r\nde mes sentiments.\nLOUIS VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1801.\nDEAR RIES,--\nI send you herewith the four parts corrected by\r\nme; please compare the others already written out\r\nwith these. I also enclose a letter to Count\r\nBrowne. I have told him that he must make an\r\nadvance to you of fifty ducats, to enable you to\r\nget your outfit. This is absolutely necessary, so it\r\ncannot offend him; for after being equipped, you\r\nare to go with him to Baden on the Monday of the\r\nensuing week. I must, however, reproach you for\r\nnot having had recourse to me long ago. Am I\r\nnot your true friend? Why did you conceal your\r\nnecessities from me? No friend of mine shall ever\r\nbe in need, so long as I have anything myself. I\r\nwould already have sent you a small sum, did I not\r\nrely on Browne; if he fails us, then apply at once\r\nto your\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, April 8, 1802.\nDo you mean to go post-haste to the devil, gentlemen,\r\nby proposing that I should write such a\r\nsonata? During the revolutionary fever, a thing\r\nof the kind might have been appropriate, but now,\r\nwhen everything is falling again into the beaten\r\ntrack, and Bonaparte has concluded a Concordat\r\nwith the Pope--such a sonata as this? If it were\r\na missa pro Sancta Maria \xc3\xa0 tre voci, or a vesper,\r\n&c., then I would at once take up my pen and\r\nwrite a Credo in unum, in gigantic semibreves. But,\r\ngood heavens! such a sonata, in this fresh dawning\r\nChristian epoch. No, no!--it won\'t do, and I\r\nwill have none of it.\nNow for my answer in quickest tempo. The\r\nlady can have a sonata from me, and I am willing to\r\nadopt the general outlines of her plan in an aesthetical\r\npoint of view, without adhering to the keys\r\nnamed. The price to be five ducats; for this sum\r\nshe can keep the work a year for her own amusement,\r\nwithout either of us being entitled to publish\r\nit. After the lapse of a year, the sonata to revert\r\nto me--that is, I can and will then publish it,\r\nwhen, if she considers it any distinction, she may\r\nrequest me to dedicate it to her.\nI now, gentlemen, commend you to the grace of\r\nGod. My Sonata [Op. 22] is well engraved, but\r\nyou have been a fine time about it! I hope you\r\nwill usher my Septet into the world a little quicker,\r\nas the P---- is waiting for it, and you know the\r\nEmpress has it; and when there are in this imperial\r\ncity people like ----, I cannot be answerable\r\nfor the result; so lose no time!\nHerr ---- [Mollo?] has lately published my\r\nQuartets [Op. 18] full of faults and errata, both\r\nlarge and small, which swarm in them like fish in\r\nthe sea; that is, they are innumerable. Questo \xc3\xa8 un\r\npiacere per un autore--this is what I call engraving\r\n[stechen, stinging] with a vengeance.[1] In\r\ntruth, my skin is a mass of punctures and scratches\r\nfrom this fine edition of my Quartets! Now farewell,\r\nand think of me as I do of you. Till death,\r\nyour faithful\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nHeiligenstadt, Oct. 6, 1802.\nOh! ye who think or declare me to be hostile,\r\nmorose, and misanthropical, how unjust you are,\r\nand how little you know the secret cause of what\r\nappears thus to you! My heart and mind were\r\never from childhood prone to the most tender feelings\r\nof affection, and I was always disposed to accomplish\r\nsomething great. But you must remember\r\nthat six years ago I was attacked by an incurable\r\nmalady, aggravated by unskilful physicians,\r\ndeluded from year to year, too, by the hope of relief,\r\nand at length forced to the conviction of a lasting\r\naffliction (the cure of which may go on for\r\nyears, and perhaps after all prove impracticable).\nBorn with a passionate and excitable temperament,\r\nkeenly susceptible to the pleasures of society,\r\nI was yet obliged early in life to isolate myself, and\r\nto pass my existence in solitude. If I at any time\r\nresolved to surmount all this, oh! how cruelly was\r\nI again repelled by the experience, sadder than\r\never, of my defective hearing!--and yet I found\r\nit impossible to say to others: Speak louder; shout!\r\nfor I am deaf! Alas! how could I proclaim the\r\ndeficiency of a sense which ought to have been\r\nmore perfect with me than with other men,--a\r\nsense which I once possessed in the highest perfection,\r\nto an extent, indeed, that few of my profession\r\never enjoyed! Alas, I cannot do this! Forgive me\r\ntherefore when you see me withdraw from you with\r\nwhom I would so gladly mingle. My misfortune is\r\ndoubly severe from causing me to be misunderstood.\r\nNo longer can I enjoy recreation in social intercourse,\r\nrefined conversation, or mutual outpourings\r\nof thought. Completely isolated, I only enter society\r\nwhen compelled to do so. I must live like an exile.\r\nIn company I am assailed by the most painful apprehensions,\r\nfrom the dread of being exposed to\r\nthe risk of my condition being observed. It was\r\nthe same during the last six months I spent in the\r\ncountry. My intelligent physician recommended\r\nme to spare my hearing as much as possible, which\r\nwas quite in accordance with my present disposition,\r\nthough sometimes, tempted by my natural inclination\r\nfor society, I allowed myself to be beguiled into\r\nit. But what humiliation when any one beside me\r\nheard a flute in the far distance, while I heard\r\nnothing, or when others heard a shepherd singing,\r\nand I still heard nothing! Such things brought me\r\nto the verge of desperation, and wellnigh caused\r\nme to put an end to my life. Art! art alone,\r\ndeterred me. Ah! how could I possibly quit the\r\nworld before bringing forth all that I felt it was\r\nmy vocation to produce?[2] And thus I spared this\r\nmiserable life--so utterly miserable that any sudden\r\nchange may reduce me at any moment from\r\nmy best condition into the worst. It is decreed\r\nthat I must now choose Patience for my guide!\r\nThis I have done. I hope the resolve will not fail\r\nme, steadfastly to persevere till it may please the\r\ninexorable Fates to cut the thread of my life. Perhaps\r\nI may get better, perhaps not. I am prepared\r\nfor either. Constrained to become a philosopher in\r\nmy twenty-eighth year![3] This is no slight trial,\r\nand more severe on an artist than on any one else.\r\nGod looks into my heart, He searches it, and knows\r\nthat love for man and feelings of benevolence have\r\ntheir abode there! Oh! ye who may one day read\r\nthis, think that you have done me injustice, and let\r\nany one similarly afflicted be consoled, by finding\r\none like himself, who, in defiance of all the obstacles\r\nof Nature, has done all in his power to be included\r\nin the ranks of estimable artists and men. My\r\nbrothers Carl and Johann, as soon as I am no more,\r\nif Professor Schmidt [see Nos. 18 and 23] be still\r\nalive, beg him in my name to describe my malady,\r\nand to add these pages to the analysis of my disease,\r\nthat at least, so far as possible, the world may be\r\nreconciled to me after my death. I also hereby\r\ndeclare you both heirs of my small fortune (if so\r\nit may be called). Share it fairly, agree together\r\nand assist each other. You know that anything\r\nyou did to give me pain has been long forgiven. I\r\nthank you, my brother Carl in particular, for the\r\nattachment you have shown me of late. My wish\r\nis that you may enjoy a happier life, and one more\r\nfree from care, than mine has been. Recommend\r\nVirtue to your children; that alone, and not wealth,\r\ncan ensure happiness. I speak from experience.\r\nIt was Virtue alone which sustained me in my misery;\r\nI have to thank her and Art for not having\r\nended my life by suicide. Farewell! Love each\r\nother. I gratefully thank all my friends, especially\r\nPrince Lichnowsky and Professor Schmidt. I wish\r\none of you to keep Prince L----\'s instruments;\r\nbut I trust this will give rise to no dissension between\r\nyou. If you think it more beneficial, however,\r\nyou have only to dispose of them. How\r\nmuch I shall rejoice if I can serve you even in the\r\ngrave! So be it then! I joyfully hasten to meet\r\nDeath. If he comes before I have had the opportunity\r\nof developing all my artistic powers, then,\r\nnotwithstanding my cruel fate, he will come too\r\nearly for me, and I should wish for him at a more\r\ndistant period; but even then I shall be content,\r\nfor his advent will release me from a state of endless\r\nsuffering. Come when he may, I shall meet\r\nhim with courage. Farewell! Do not quite forget\r\nme, even in death; I deserve this from you,\r\nbecause during my life I so often thought of you,\r\nand wished to make you happy. Amen!\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n(Written on the Outside.)\nThus, then, I take leave of you, and with sadness\r\ntoo. The fond hope I brought with me here, of\r\nbeing to a certain degree cured, now utterly forsakes\r\nme. As autumn leaves fall and wither, so\r\nare my hopes blighted. Almost as I came, I depart.\r\nEven the lofty courage that so often animated\r\nme in the lovely days of summer is gone forever.\r\nO Providence! vouchsafe me one day of\r\npure felicity! How long have I been estranged\r\nfrom the glad echo of true joy! When! O my\r\nGod! when shall I again feel it in the temple of\r\nNature and of man?--never? Ah! that would be\r\ntoo hard!\n(Outside.)\nTo be read and fulfilled after my death by my\r\nbrothers Carl and Johann.\nNovember, 1802.\nI owe it to the public and to myself to state that\r\nthe two quintets in C and E flat major--one of\r\nthese (arranged from a symphony of mine) published\r\nby Herr Mollo in Vienna, and the other\r\n(taken from my Septet, Op. 20) by Herr Hofmeister\r\nin Leipzig--are not original quintets, but only\r\nversions of the aforesaid works given by the publishers.\r\nArrangements in these days (so fruitful in--arrangements)\r\nan author will find it vain to contend\r\nagainst; but we may at least justly demand\r\nthat the fact should be mentioned in the title-page,\r\nneither to injure the reputation of the author nor to\r\ndeceive the public. This notice is given to prevent\r\nanything of the kind in future. I also beg\r\nto announce that shortly a new original quintet of\r\nmy composition, in C major, Op. 29, will appear at\r\nBreitkopf & H\xc3\xa4rtel\'s in Leipzig.\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nSummer of 1803.\nYou no doubt are aware that I am here. Go to\r\nStein, and ask if he can send me an instrument, on\r\nhire. I am afraid of bringing mine here. Come\r\nto me this evening about seven o\'clock. I lodge in\r\nOberd\xc3\xb6bling, on the left side of the street, No. 4,\r\ngoing down the hill towards Heiligenstadt.\nVienna, Sept. 22, 1803.\nI hereby declare all the works you have ordered\r\nto be your property. The list of these shall be made\r\nout and sent to you with my signature, as the\r\nproof of their being your own. I also agree to accept\r\nthe sum of fifty ducats for them. Are you\r\nsatisfied?\nPerhaps, instead of the variations with violoncello\r\nand violin,[1] I may send you variations for the piano,\r\narranged as a duet on a song of mine; but Goethe\'s\r\npoetry must also be engraved, as I wrote these variations\r\nin an album, and consider them better than\r\nthe others. Are you satisfied?\nThe arrangements are not by me, though I have\r\nrevised and much improved various passages; but\r\nI do not wish you to say that I have arranged them,\r\nfor it would be false, and I have neither time nor\r\npatience to do so. Are you satisfied?\nNow farewell! I sincerely wish that all may go\r\nwell with you. I would gladly make you a present\r\nof all my works, if I could do so and still get on in\r\nthe world; but--remember most people are provided\r\nfor, and know what they have to live on,\r\nwhile, good heavens! where can an appointment\r\nbe found at the Imperial Court for such a parvum\r\ntalentum com ego?\nYour friend,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nNovember, 1803.\nHerr Carl Zulehner, a piratical engraver in\r\nMayence, has announced an edition of my collected\r\nworks for the pianoforte and also stringed instruments.\r\nI consider it my duty publicly to inform\r\nall friends of music that I have no share whatever\r\nin this edition.\nI would never have in any way authorized any\r\ncollection of my works (which, moreover, I consider\r\npremature) without previously consulting the\r\npublishers of single pieces, and ensuring that correctness\r\nin which editions of my individual works\r\nare so deficient. I must also observe that this illegal\r\nedition cannot be complete, as several new\r\nworks of mine are shortly to appear in Paris, and\r\nthese Herr Zulehner, being a French subject, dare\r\nnot pirate. I intend to take another opportunity\r\nof enumerating the details of the collection of my\r\nworks to be brought out under my own auspices\r\nand careful revision.\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1804.\nBe so good as to make out a list of the mistakes\r\nand send it at once to Simrock, and say that the\r\nwork must appear as soon as possible. I will send\r\nhim the Sonata [Op. 47] and the Concerto the day\r\nafter to-morrow.\nBEETHOVEN.\nI must again ask you to undertake the disagreeable\r\ntask of making a fair copy of the errors in the\r\nZurich Sonata. I have got your list of errata "auf\r\nder Wieden."\nDEAR RIES,--\nThe signs are wrongly marked, and many of the\r\nnotes misplaced; so be careful! or your labor will\r\nbe vain. Ch\' a detto l\' amato bene?\nDEAR RIES,--\nMay I beg you to be so obliging as to copy this\r\nandante [in the Kreuzer Sonata] for me, however\r\nindifferently? I must send it off to-morrow, and\r\nas Heaven alone knows what its fate may then be,\r\nI wish to get it transcribed. But I must have it\r\nback to-morrow about one o\'clock. The cause of\r\nmy troubling you is that one of my copyists is already\r\nvery much occupied with various things of\r\nimportance, and the other is ill.\nDORF DES LEIDES [VILLAGE OF SORROW--LEIDESDORF],--\nLet the bearer of this, Herr Ries, have some\r\neasy duets, and, better still, let him have them\r\nfor nothing. Conduct yourself in accordance with\r\nthe reformed doctrines. Farewell!\nBEETHOVEN\nMinimus.\nBaden, July 14, 1804.\nDEAR RIES,--\nIf you can find me better lodgings, I shall be\r\nvery glad. Tell my brothers not to engage these\r\nat once; I have a great desire to get one in a spacious,\r\nquiet square or on the Bastei. It it really\r\ninexcusable in my brother not to have provided\r\nwine, as it is so beneficial and necessary to me. I\r\nshall take care to be present at the rehearsal on\r\nWednesday. I am not pleased to hear that it is to\r\nbe at Schuppanzigh\'s. He may well be grateful to\r\nme if my impertinences make him thinner! Farewell,\r\ndear Ries! We have bad weather here, and\r\nI am not safe from visitors; so I must take flight\r\nin order to be alone.\nYour true friend,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nBaden, July, 1804.\nDEAR RIES,--\nAs Breuning [see Nos. 13, 14, and 18] by his\r\nconduct has not scrupled to display my character to\r\nyou and the house-steward as that of a mean, petty,\r\nbase man, I beg you will convey my reply at once\r\nin person to Breuning. I answer only one point,\r\nthe first in his letter, and I do so solely because it\r\nis the only mode of justifying myself in your eyes.\r\nSay also to him that I had no intention of reproaching\r\nhim on account of the delay of the notice to\r\nquit, and even if Breuning were really to blame\r\nfor this, our harmonious relations are so dear and\r\nprecious in my sight, that, for the sake of a few\r\nhundreds more or less, I would never subject any\r\nfriend of mine to vexation. You are aware, indeed,\r\nthat I jestingly accused you as the cause of the notice\r\narriving too late. I am quite sure that you\r\nmust remember this. I had entirely forgotten the\r\nwhole matter, but at dinner my brother began to\r\nsay that he thought Breuning was to blame in the\r\naffair, which I at once denied, saying that you were\r\nin fault. I think this shows plainly enough that I\r\nattributed no blame to Breuning; but on this he\r\nsprang up like a madman, and insisted on sending\r\nfor the house-steward. Such behavior, in the\r\npresence of all those with whom I usually associate,\r\nand to which I am wholly unaccustomed, caused\r\nme to lose all self-control; so I also started up, upset\r\nmy chair, left the room, and did not return.\r\nThis conduct induced Breuning to place me in a\r\npretty light to you and the house-steward, and also\r\nto send me a letter which I only answered by silence.\r\nI have not another word to say to Breuning.\r\nHis mode of thinking and of acting, with regard\r\nto me, proves that there never ought to have\r\nbeen such friendly intimacy between us, and assuredly\r\nit can never more be restored. I wished\r\nto make you acquainted with this, as your version\r\nof the occurrence degraded both my words and actions.\r\nI know that, had you been aware of the\r\nreal state of the affair, you would not have said\r\nwhat you did, and with this I am satisfied.\nI now beg of you, dear Ries, to go to my brother,\r\nthe apothecary, as soon as you receive this letter,\r\nand say to him that I mean to leave Baden in the\r\ncourse of a few days, and that he is to engage the\r\nlodging in D\xc3\xb6bling as soon as you have given him\r\nthis message. I had nearly left this to-day; I detest\r\nbeing here--I am sick of it. For Heaven\'s sake\r\nurge him to close the bargain at once, for I want\r\nto take possession immediately. Neither show nor\r\nspeak to any one of what is written in the previous\r\npage of this letter. I wish to prove to him in every\r\nrespect that I am not so meanly disposed as he is.\r\nIndeed I have written to him, although my resolve\r\nas to the dissolution of our friendship remains firm\r\nand unchangeable.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nBerlin, July 24, 1804.\n... You were no doubt not a little surprised\r\nabout the affair with Breuning; believe me, my\r\ndear friend, that the ebullition on my part was\r\nonly an outbreak caused by many previous scenes\r\nof a disagreeable nature. I have the gift of being\r\nable to conceal and to repress my susceptibility on\r\nmany occasions; but if attacked at a time when I\r\nchance to be peculiarly irritable, I burst forth more\r\nviolently than any one. Breuning certainly possesses\r\nmany admirable qualities, but he thinks himself\r\nquite faultless; whereas the very defects that\r\nhe discovers in others are those which he possesses\r\nhimself to the highest degree. From my childhood\r\nI have always despised his petty mind. My\r\npowers of discrimination enabled me to foresee the\r\nresult with Breuning, for our modes of thinking,\r\nacting, and feeling are entirely opposite; and yet I\r\nbelieved that these difficulties might be overcome,\r\nbut experience has disproved this. So now I want\r\nno more of his friendship! I have only found two\r\nfriends in the world with whom I never had a misunderstanding;\r\nbut what men these were! One is\r\ndead, the other still lives. Although for nearly six\r\nyears past we have seen nothing of each other, yet\r\nI know that I still hold the first place in his heart,\r\nas he does in mine [see No. 12]. The true basis\r\nof friendship is to be found in sympathy of heart\r\nand soul. I only wish you could have read the letter\r\nI wrote to Breuning, and his to me. No!\r\nnever can he be restored to his former place in my\r\nheart. The man who could attribute to his friend\r\nso base a mode of thinking, and could himself have\r\nrecourse to so base a mode of acting towards him,\r\nis no longer worthy of my friendship.\nDo not forget the affair of my apartments.\r\nFarewell! Do not be too much addicted to tailoring,[1]\r\nremember me to the fairest of the fair, and\r\nsend me half a dozen needles.\nI never could have believed that I could be so\r\nidle as I am here. If this be followed by a fit of\r\nindustry, something worth while may be produced.\nVale! Your\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, June 1, 1805.\nI must inform you that the affair about the new\r\nquintet is settled between Count Fries and myself.\nThe Count has just assured me that he intends\r\nto make you a present of it; it is too late to-day\r\nfor a written agreement on the subject, but one\r\nshall be sent early in the ensuing week. This intelligence\r\nmust suffice for the present, and I think\r\nI at all events deserve your thanks for it.\nYour obedient servant,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nNovember, 1805.\nPray pardon me, illustrious Princess, if the\r\nbearer of this should cause you an unpleasant surprise.\r\nPoor Ries, my scholar, is forced by this\r\nunhappy war to shoulder a musket, and must moreover\r\nleave this in a few days, being a foreigner.\r\nHe has nothing, literally nothing, and is obliged to\r\ntake a long journey. All chance of a concert on\r\nhis behalf is thus entirely at an end, and he must\r\nhave recourse to the benevolence of others. I recommend\r\nhim to you. I know you will forgive the\r\nstep I have taken. A noble-minded man would\r\nonly have recourse to such measures in the most\r\nutter extremity. Confident of this, I send the poor\r\nyouth to you, in the hope of somewhat improving\r\nhis circumstances. He is forced to apply to all who\r\nknow him.\nI am, with the deepest respect, yours,\r\nL. VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1805.\nDEAR MEYER,--\nPray try to persuade Herr v. Seyfried to direct\r\nmy Opera, as I wish on this occasion to see and\r\nhear it myself from a distance; in this way my patience\r\nwill at all events not be so severely tried as\r\nwhen I am close enough to hear my music so bungled.\r\nI really do believe that it is done on purpose\r\nto annoy me! I will say nothing of the wind-instruments;\r\nbut all pp.\'s, cresc., discresc., and all\r\nf.\'s and ff.\'s may as well be struck out of my Opera,\r\nfor no attention whatever is paid to them. I shall\r\nlose all pleasure in composing anything in future,\r\nif I am to hear it given thus. To-morrow or the\r\nday after I will come to fetch you to dinner. To-day\r\nI am again unwell.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nIf the Opera is to be performed the day after\r\nto-morrow, there must be another private rehearsal\r\nto-morrow, or each time it will be given worse\r\nand worse.\nVienna, Dec. 7, 1805.\nI, the undersigned, am glad to bear testimony\r\nto young Carl Czerny having made the most extraordinary\r\nprogress on the pianoforte, far beyond\r\nwhat might be expected at the age of fourteen. I\r\nconsider him deserving of all possible assistance,\r\nnot only from what I have already referred to, but\r\nfrom his astonishing memory, and more especially\r\nfrom his parents having spent all their means in\r\ncultivating the talent of their promising son.\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nDEAR R\xc3\x96CKEL,--\nBe sure that you arrange matters properly with\r\nMdlle. Milder, and say to her previously from me,\r\nthat I hope she will not sing anywhere else. I intend\r\nto call on her to-morrow, to kiss the hem of\r\nher garment. Do not also forget Marconi, and forgive\r\nme for giving you so much trouble.\nYours wholly,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nMY ESTEEMED COLLIN,--\nI hear that you are about to fulfil my greatest\r\nwish and your own purpose. Much as I desire to\r\nexpress my delight to you in person, I cannot find\r\ntime to do so, having so much to occupy me. Pray\r\ndo not then ascribe this to any want of proper attention\r\ntowards you. I send you the "Armida";\r\nas soon as you have entirely done with it, pray return\r\nit, as it does not belong to me. I am, with\r\nsincere esteem,\nYours,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nI should like very much, my good Gleichenstein,\r\nto speak to you this forenoon between one and two\r\no\'clock, or in the afternoon, and where you please.\r\nTo-day I am too busy to call early enough to find\r\nyou at home. Give me an answer, and don\'t forget\r\nto appoint the place for us to meet. Farewell,\r\nand continue your regard for your\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, December, 1807.\nThe undersigned has cause to flatter himself\r\nthat during the period of his stay in Vienna he has\r\ngained some favor and approbation from the highest\r\nnobility, as well as from the public at large, his\r\nworks having met with an honorable reception both\r\nin this and other countries. Nevertheless he has\r\nhad difficulties of every kind to contend against,\r\nand has not hitherto been so fortunate as to acquire\r\na position that would enable him to live solely for art,\r\nand to develop his talents to a still higher degree\r\nof perfection, which ought to be the aim of every\r\nartist, thus ensuring future independence instead of\r\nmere casual profits.\nThe mere wish to gain a livelihood has never\r\nbeen the leading clew that has hitherto guided the\r\nundersigned on his path. His great aim has been\r\nthe interest of art and the ennobling of taste, while\r\nhis genius, soaring to a higher ideal and greater\r\nperfection, frequently compelled him to sacrifice his\r\ntalents and profits to the Muse. Still works of this\r\nkind won for him a reputation in distant lands, securing\r\nhim the most favorable reception in various\r\nplaces of distinction, and a position befitting his\r\ntalents and acquirements.\nThe undersigned does not, however, hesitate to\r\nsay that this city is above all others the most precious\r\nand desirable in his eyes, owing to the number\r\nof years he has lived here, the favor and approval\r\nhe has enjoyed from both high and low, and\r\nhis wish fully to realize the expectations he has had\r\nthe good fortune to excite, but most of all, he may\r\ntruly say, from his patriotism as a German. Before,\r\ntherefore, making up his mind to leave a place\r\nso dear to him, he begs to refer to a hint which the\r\nreigning Prince Lichnowsky was so kind as to give\r\nhim, to the effect that the directors of the theatre\r\nwere disposed to engage the undersigned on reasonable\r\nconditions in the service of their theatre,\r\nand to ensure his remaining in Vienna by securing\r\nto him a permanent position, more propitious to the\r\nfurther exercise of his talents. As this assurance\r\nis entirely in accordance with the wishes of the undersigned,\r\nhe takes the liberty, with all due respect,\r\nto place before the directors his readiness to enter\r\ninto such an engagement, and begs to state the following\r\nconditions for their gracious consideration.\n1. The undersigned undertakes and pledges himself\r\nto compose each year at least one grand opera,\r\nto be selected by the directors and himself; in return\r\nfor this he demands a fixed salary of 2400\r\nflorins a year, and also a free benefit at the third\r\nperformance of each such opera.\n2. He also agrees to supply the directors annually\r\nwith a little operetta or a divertissement, with\r\nchoruses or occasional music of the kind, as may be\r\nrequired, gratis; he feels confident that on the other\r\nhand the directors will not refuse, in return for\r\nthese various labors, to grant him a benefit concert at\r\nall events once a year in one of the theatres. Surely\r\nthe above conditions cannot be thought exorbitant\r\nor unreasonable, when the expenditure of time and\r\nenergy entailed by the production of an opera is\r\ntaken into account, as it entirely excludes the possibility\r\nof all other mental exertion; in other places,\r\ntoo, the author and his family have a share in the\r\nprofits of every individual performance, so that even\r\none successful work at once ensures the future fortunes\r\nof the composer. It must also be considered\r\nhow prejudicial the present rate of exchange is to artists\r\nhere, and likewise the high price of the necessaries\r\nof life, while a residence in foreign countries is\r\nopen to them.\nBut in any event, whether the directors accede\r\nto or decline this present proposal, the undersigned\r\nventures to request that he may be permitted to\r\ngive a concert for his own benefit in one of the\r\ntheatres. For if his conditions be accepted, the\r\nundersigned must devote all his time and talents to\r\nthe composition of such an opera, and thus be prevented\r\nworking in any other way for profit. In\r\ncase of the non-acceptance of these proposals, as\r\nthe concert he was authorized to give last year did\r\nnot take place owing to various obstacles, he would\r\nentreat, as a parting token of the favor hitherto\r\nvouchsafed to him, that the promise of last year may\r\nnow be fulfilled. In the former case, he would beg\r\nto suggest Annunciation Day [March 25.] for his\r\nconcert, and in the latter a day during the ensuing\r\nChristmas vacation.\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN, M.P.\r\n[Manu propria.]\nVienna, Nov. 1, 1808 [sic!].\nMY DEAR COUNT,--\nI fear you will look on me with displeasure when\r\nI tell you that necessity compelled me not only to\r\ndispose of the symphony I wrote for you, but to\r\ntransfer another also to some one else. Be assured,\r\nhowever, that you shall soon receive the one I intend\r\nfor you. I hope that both you and the Countess,\r\nto whom I beg my kind regards, have been\r\nwell since we met. I am at this moment staying\r\nwith Countess Erd\xc3\xb6dy in the apartments below\r\nthose of Prince Lichnowsky. I mention this in case\r\nyou do me the honor to call on me when you are in\r\nVienna. My circumstances are improving, without\r\nhaving recourse to the intervention of people\r\nwho treat their friends insultingly. I have also the\r\noffer of being made Kapellmeister to the King of\r\nWestphalia, and it is possible that I may accept the\r\nproposal. Farewell, and sometimes think of your\r\nattached friend,\nBEETHOVEN.\nI fear I am too late for to-day, but I have only\r\nnow been able to get back your memorial from\r\nC----, because H---- wished to add various items\r\nhere and there. I do beg of you to dwell chiefly\r\non the great importance to me of adequate opportunities\r\nto exercise my art; by so doing you will\r\nwrite what is most in accordance with my head and\r\nmy heart. The preamble must set forth what I am\r\nto have in Westphalia--600 ducats in gold, 150\r\nducats for travelling expenses; all I have to do in\r\nreturn for this sum being to direct the King\'s [Jerome\'s]\r\nconcerts, which are short and few in number.\r\nI am not even bound to direct any opera I\r\nmay write. So, thus freed from all care, I shall be\r\nable to devote myself entirely to the most important\r\nobject of my art--to write great works. An\r\norchestra is also to be placed at my disposition.\nN.B. As member of a theatrical association, the\r\ntitle need not be insisted on, as it can produce nothing\r\nbut annoyance. With regard to the Imperial\r\nservice, I think that point requires delicate handling,\r\nand not less so the solicitation for the title of Imperial\r\nKapellmeister. It must, however, be made\r\nquite clear that I am to receive a sufficient salary\r\nfrom the Court to enable me to renounce the annuity\r\nwhich I at present receive from the gentlemen\r\nin question [the Archduke Rudolph, Prince\r\nKinsky, and Prince Lobkowitz], which I think will\r\nbe most suitably expressed by my stating that it is\r\nmy hope, and has ever been my most ardent wish,\r\nto enter the Imperial service, when I shall be ready\r\nto give up as much of the above salary as the sum\r\nI am to receive from His Imperial Majesty amounts\r\nto. (N.B. We must have it to-morrow at twelve\r\no\'clock, as we go to Kinsky then. I hope to see\r\nyou to-day.)\nThe aim and endeavor of every true artist must\r\nbe to acquire a position in which he can occupy\r\nhimself exclusively with the accomplishment of\r\ngreat works, undisturbed by other avocations or by\r\nconsiderations of economy. A composer, therefore,\r\ncan have no more ardent wish than to devote himself\r\nwholly to the creation of works of importance,\r\nto be produced before the public. He must also\r\nkeep in view the prospect of old age, in order to\r\nmake a sufficient provision for that period.\nThe King of Westphalia has offered Beethoven\r\na salary of 600 gold ducats for life, and 150 ducats\r\nfor travelling expenses, in return for which his sole\r\nobligations are, occasionally to play before His\r\nMajesty, and to conduct his chamber concerts,\r\nwhich are both few and short. This proposal is of\r\na most beneficial nature both to art and the artist.\nBeethoven, however, much prefers a residence in\r\nthis capital, feeling so much gratitude for the many\r\nproofs of kindness he has received in it, and so\r\nmuch patriotism for his adopted father-land, that he\r\nwill never cease to consider himself an Austrian artist,\r\nnor take up his abode elsewhere, if anything\r\napproaching to the same advantages are conferred\r\non him here.\nAs many persons of high, indeed of the very\r\nhighest rank, have requested him to name the conditions\r\non which he would be disposed to remain\r\nhere, in compliance with their wish he states as\r\nfollows:--\n1. Beethoven must receive from some influential\r\nnobleman security for a permanent salary for life:\r\nvarious persons of consideration might contribute\r\nto make up the amount of this salary, which, at the\r\npresent increased price of all commodities, must\r\nnot consist of less than 4000 florins per annum.\r\nBeethoven\'s wish is that the donors of this sum\r\nshould be considered as cooperating in the production\r\nof his future great works, by thus enabling\r\nhim to devote himself entirely to these labors, and\r\nby relieving him from all other occupations.\n2. Beethoven must always retain the privilege of\r\ntravelling in the interests of art, for in this way\r\nalone can he make himself known, and acquire\r\nsome fortune.\n3. His most ardent desire and eager wish is to\r\nbe received into the Imperial service, when such an\r\nappointment would enable him partly or wholly to\r\nrenounce the proposed salary. In the mean time\r\nthe title of Imperial Kapellmeister would be very\r\ngratifying to him; and if this wish could be realized,\r\nthe value of his abode here would be much enhanced\r\nin his eyes.\nIf his desire be fulfilled, and a salary granted by\r\nHis Majesty to Beethoven, he will renounce so\r\nmuch of the said 4000 florins as the Imperial salary\r\nshall amount to; or if this appointment be 4000\r\nflorins, he will give up the whole of the former\r\nsum.\n4. As Beethoven wishes from time to time to\r\nproduce before the public at large his new great\r\nworks, he desires an assurance from the present\r\ndirectors of the theatre on their part, and that of\r\ntheir successors, that they will authorize him to\r\ngive a concert for his own benefit every year on\r\nPalm Sunday, in the Theatre "an der Wien." In\r\nreturn for which Beethoven agrees to arrange and\r\ndirect an annual concert for the benefit of the poor,\r\nor, if this cannot be managed, at all events to furnish\r\na new work of his own for such a concert.\nDecember, 1808.\nMY EXCELLENT FRIEND,--\nAll would go well now if we had only a curtain,\r\nwithout it the Aria ["Ah! Perfido"] will be a\r\nfailure.[1] I only heard this to-day from S. [Seyfried],\r\nand it vexes me much: a curtain of any\r\nkind will do, even a bed-curtain, or merely a kind\r\nof gauze screen, which could be instantly removed.\r\nThere must be something; for the Aria is in the\r\ndramatic style, and better adapted for the stage than\r\nfor effect in a concert-room. Without a curtain, or\r\nsomething of the sort, the Aria will be devoid of all\r\nmeaning, and ruined! ruined! ruined!! Devil take\r\nit all! The Court will probably be present.\r\nBaron Schweitzer [Chamberlain of the Archduke\r\nAnton] requested me earnestly to make the application\r\nmyself. Archduke Carl granted me an\r\naudience and promised to come. The Empress\r\nneither promised nor refused.\nA hanging curtain!!!! or the Aria and I will\r\nboth be hanged to-morrow. Farewell! I embrace\r\nyou as cordially on this new year as in the old one.\r\nWith or without a curtain! Your\nBEETHOVEN.\n1809.\nMY DEAR FELLOW,--\nYour friends have at any rate given you very\r\nbad advice; but I know all about them: they are the\r\nvery same to whom you sent that fine news about\r\nme from Paris; the very same who inquired about\r\nmy age--information that you contrived to supply\r\nso correctly!--the very same who have often before\r\ninjured you in my opinion, but now permanently.\r\nFarewell!\nBEETHOVEN.\nMarch 7, 1809.\nIt is just what I expected! As to the blows,\r\nthat is rather far-fetched. The story is at least\r\nthree months\' old, and very different from what he\r\nnow makes it out to be. The whole stupid affair\r\nwas caused by a female huckster and a couple of\r\nlow fellows. I lose very little. He no doubt was\r\ncorrupted in the very house where I am now living.\nMy most excellent, high, and well-born Herr v.\r\nZmeskall, Court Secretary and Member of the\r\nSociety of the Single Blessed,--If I come to see\r\nyou to-day, ascribe it to the fact that a person\r\nwishes to speak to me at your house whom I could\r\nnot refuse to see. I come without any card from\r\nyou, but I hope you will not on that account discard\r\nme.\nYours truly--most truly,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nIt seems to me, dear Zmeskall, if war really\r\ndoes break out, when it comes to an end you will\r\nbe the very man for an appointment in the Peace\r\nLegation. What a glorious office!!! I leave it\r\nentirely to you to do the best you can about my\r\nservant, only henceforth Countess Erd\xc3\xb6dy must not\r\nattempt to exercise the smallest influence over him.\r\nShe says she made him a present of twenty-five\r\nflorins, and gave him five florins a month, solely to\r\ninduce him to stay with me. I cannot refuse to\r\nbelieve this trait of generosity, but I do not choose\r\nthat it should be repeated. Farewell! I thank\r\nyou for your friendship, and hope soon to see you.\nYours ever,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nApril 16, 1809.\nIf I cannot come to-day, dear Zmeskall which\r\nis very possible, ask Baroness von ---- [name illegible]\r\nto give you the pianoforte part of the Trios,\r\nand be so good as to send them and the other parts\r\nto me to-day.\nIn haste, your\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nApril 17, 1809.\nDEAR Z.,--\nA suitable lodging has just been found out for\r\nme, but I need some one to help me in the affair. I\r\ncannot employ my brother, because he only recommends\r\nwhat costs least money. Let me know,\r\ntherefore, if we can go together to look at the\r\nhouse. It is in the Klepperstall.[1]\nApril 25, 1809.\nI shall be glad, right glad, to play. I send you\r\nthe violoncello part; if you find that you can\r\nmanage it, play it yourself, or let old Kraft[1] do so.\r\nI will tell you about the lodging when we meet.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nMay 14, 1809.\nMY DEAR LITTLE MUSICAL OLD COUNT!--\nI think after all it would be advisable to let old\r\nKraft play, as the trios are to be heard for the first\r\ntime (in society), and you can play them afterwards;\r\nbut I leave it all to your own option. If\r\nyou meet with any difficulties, one of which may\r\npossibly be that Kraft and S. [Schuppanzigh] do\r\nnot harmonize well together, then Herr v. Zmeskall\r\nmust distinguish himself, not as a mere musical\r\nCount, but as an energetic musician.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1809.\nI feel almost ashamed of your complaisance and\r\nkindness in permitting me to see the MS. of your\r\nas yet unknown literary treasures. Pray receive\r\nmy sincere thanks. I also beg to return both your\r\noperettas. Wholly engrossed by my professional\r\navocations, it is impossible for me to give an opinion,\r\nespecially with regard to the Indian Operetta; as\r\nsoon as time permits, I will call on you for the\r\npurpose of discussing this subject, and also the\r\nOratorio of "The Deluge." Pray always include\r\nme among the warm admirers of your great\r\ntalents.\nI am, sir, with sincere esteem, your obedient\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1809.\nForgive me, my dear H----, for not having\r\nbrought you the letter for Paris. I have been, and\r\nstill am, so much occupied, that day after day I am\r\nobliged to delay writing it, but you shall have it to-morrow,\r\neven if I am unable to come myself to see\r\nyou, which I am most anxious to do.\nThere is another matter that I would most\r\nearnestly press on you; perhaps you might succeed\r\nin doing something for a poor unfortunate man. I\r\nallude to Herr Stoll, son of the celebrated physician.\r\nWith many persons the question is whether\r\na man has been ruined by his own fault or by that\r\nof others, but this is not so with either you or me;\r\nit is sufficient that Stoll is unfortunate, and looks on\r\na journey to Paris as his sole resource, having last\r\nyear made many influential acquaintances, who,\r\nwhen he goes there, are to endeavor to procure\r\nhim a professorship in Westphalia. Stoll has therefore\r\napplied to Herr v. Neumann, in the State\r\nChancery Office, to send him with a government\r\ncourier to Paris, but the latter refuses to take him\r\nfor less than twenty-five louis d\'or. Now I request\r\nyou, my dear friend, to speak to Herr v. Neumann\r\nto arrange, if possible, that the courier should\r\neither take Stoll gratis, or for a small sum. I am\r\npersuaded that if there is nothing particular against\r\nit, you will be glad to interest yourself in poor Stoll.\r\nI return to the country to-day, but hope soon to be\r\nso fortunate as to enjoy an hour of your society.\r\nIn the mean time I send you my best wishes, and\r\nbeg you will believe in the sincere esteem of\nYour obedient\r\nLUDWIG v. BEETHOVEN.\nMY ESTEEMED TH\xc3\x89R\xc3\x88SE,--\nYou will receive with this what I promised.\r\nHad not many serious obstacles intervened, I would\r\nhave sent you more, in order to show you that\r\nwhere my friends are concerned I always perform\r\nmore than I promise. I hope, and do not doubt,\r\nthat you are agreeably occupied and enjoying\r\nsociety, but not too much, I trust, to prevent your\r\nthinking of us. It would show too much confidence\r\nin you, or too high an estimation of my own\r\nmerits, were I to attribute the sentiment to you,\r\n"That people are not together only when present,\r\nbut that the absent and the dead also live with us."\r\nWho could ascribe such a thought to the volatile\r\nTh\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se, who takes the world so lightly? Among\r\nyour various occupations, do not forget the piano,\r\nor rather, music in general, for which you have so\r\nfine a talent: why not then seriously cultivate it?\r\nYou, who have so much feeling for the good and\r\nthe beautiful, should strive to recognize the perfections\r\nof so charming an art, which in return always\r\ncasts so bright a reflection on us.\nI live in entire quiet and solitude, and even\r\nthough occasional flashes of light arouse me, still\r\nsince you all left this I feel a hopeless void which\r\neven my art, usually so faithful to me, has not yet\r\ntriumphed over. Your pianoforte is ordered, and\r\nyou shall soon have it. What a difference you\r\nmust have discovered between the treatment of the\r\ntheme I extemporized on the other evening and\r\nthe mode in which I have recently written it out\r\nfor you? You must explain this yourself, only do\r\nnot find the solution in the punch! How happy\r\nyou are to get away so soon to the country! I\r\ncannot enjoy this luxury till the 8th. I look forward\r\nto it with the delight of a child. What happiness\r\nI shall feel in wandering among groves and\r\nwoods, and among trees, and plants, and rocks!\r\nNo man on earth can love the country as I do!\r\nThickets, trees, and rocks supply the echo man\r\nlongs for!\nYou shall soon receive some more of my compositions,\r\nwhich will not cause you to complain so\r\nmuch of difficulties. Have you read Goethe\'s\r\n"Wilhelm Meister," and Schlegel\'s "Translations\r\nof Shakspeare"? People have so much leisure in\r\nthe country, that perhaps you would like me to send\r\nyou these works? It happens that I have an acquaintance\r\nin your neighborhood; so perhaps you\r\nmay see me some morning early for half an hour,\r\nafter which I must be off again. You will also observe\r\nthat I intend to bore you for as short a time\r\nas possible.[1]\nCommend me to the regard of your father and\r\nmother, though I have as yet no right to claim it.\r\nRemember me also to your cousin M. [Mathilde].\r\nFarewell, my esteemed Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se; I wish you all\r\nthe good and charm that life can offer. Think of\r\nme kindly, and forget my follies. Rest assured that\r\nno one would more rejoice to hear of your happiness,\r\neven were you to feel no interest in your devoted\r\nservant and friend,\nBEETHOVEN.\nN.B. It would be very amiable in you to write\r\nme a few lines, to say if I can be of any use to you\r\nhere.\nDEAR MDLLE. G.,--\nI cannot with truth deny that the verses you\r\nsent have considerably embarrassed me. It causes\r\na strange sensation to see and hear yourself praised,\r\nand yet to be conscious of your own defects, as I\r\nam. I consider such occurrences as mere incitements\r\nto strive to draw nearer the unattainable\r\ngoal set before us by Art and Nature, difficult as it\r\nmay be. These verses are truly beautiful, with the\r\nexception of one fault that we often find in poets,\r\nwhich is, their being misled by Fancy to believe\r\nthat they really do see and hear what they wish to\r\nsee and hear, and yet even this is far below their\r\nideal. You may well believe that I wish to become\r\nacquainted with the poet or poetess; pray receive\r\nalso yourself my thanks for the kindly feeling you\r\nshow towards your sincere friend,\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nJanuary 23, 1810.\nWhat are you about? My gayety yesterday,\r\nthough only assumed, has not only vexed but offended\r\nyou. The uninvited guests seemed so little\r\nto deserve your ill-humor, that I endeavored to use\r\nall my friendly influence to prevent your giving\r\nway to it, by my pretended flow of spirits. I am\r\nstill suffering from indigestion. Say whether you\r\ncan meet me at the "Swan" to-day.\nYour true friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, May 2, 1810.\nMY DEAR OLD FRIEND,--\nThese lines may very possibly cause you some\r\nsurprise, and yet, though you have no written\r\nproof of it, I always retain the most lively remembrance\r\nof you. Among my MSS. is one that has\r\nlong been destined for you, and which you shall\r\ncertainly receive this summer. For the last two\r\nyears my secluded and quiet life has been at an end,\r\nand I have been forcibly drawn into the vortex of\r\nthe world; though as yet I have attained no good\r\nresult from this,--nay, perhaps rather the reverse,\r\n--but who has not been affected by the storms\r\naround us? Still I should not only be happy, but\r\nthe happiest of men, if a demon had not taken up\r\nhis settled abode in my ears. Had I not somewhere\r\nread that man must not voluntarily put an end to\r\nhis life while he can still perform even one good\r\ndeed, I should long since have been no more, and\r\nby my own hand too! Ah! how fair is life; but for\r\nme it is forever poisoned!\nYou will not refuse me one friendly service, which\r\nis to procure me my baptismal certificate. As\r\nSteffen Breuning has an account with you, he can\r\npay any expenses you may incur, and I will repay\r\nhim here. If you think it worth while to make\r\nthe inquiry in person, and choose to make a journey\r\nfrom Coblenz to Bonn, you have only to charge\r\nit all to me. I must, however, warn you that I\r\nhad an elder brother whose name was also Ludwig,\r\nwith the second name of Maria, who died. In order\r\nto know my precise age, the date of my birth\r\nmust be first ascertained, this circumstance having\r\nalready led others into error, and caused me to be\r\nthought older than I really am. Unluckily, I lived\r\nfor some time without myself knowing my age [see\r\nNos. 26 and 51]. I had a book containing all family\r\nincidents, but it has been lost, Heaven knows\r\nhow! So pardon my urgently requesting you to\r\ntry to discover Ludwig Maria\'s birth, as well as\r\nthat of the present Ludwig. The sooner you can\r\nsend me the certificate of baptism the more obliged\r\nshall I be.[1]\r\nI am told that you sing one of my songs\r\nin your Freemason Lodge, probably the one in E\r\nmajor, which I have not myself got; send it to me,\r\nand I promise to compensate you threefold and\r\nfourfold.[2]\r\nThink of me with kindness, little as I\r\napparently deserve it. Embrace your dear wife\r\nand children, and all whom you love, in the name\r\nof your friend,\nBEETHOVEN.\nJuly 9, 1810.\nDEAR Z.,--\nYou are about to travel, and so am I on account\r\nof my health. In the mean time all goes topsy-turvy\r\nwith me. The Herr[1]\r\nwants to have me\r\nwith him, and Art is not less urgent in her claims.\r\nI am partly in Sch\xc3\xb6nbrunn and partly here; every\r\nday assailed by messages from strangers and new\r\nacquaintances, and even as regards art I am often\r\ndriven nearly distracted by my undeserved fame.\r\nFortune seeks me, and for that very reason I almost\r\ndread some new calamity. As for your\r\n"Iphig\xc3\xa9nie," the facts are these. I have not seen\r\nit for the last two years and a half, and have no\r\ndoubt lent it to some one; but to whom?--that is\r\nthe question. I have sent in all directions, and\r\nhave not yet discovered it, but hope still to find it.\r\nIf lost, you shall be indemnified. Farewell, my\r\ndear Z. I trust that when we meet again you\r\nwill find that my art has made some progress in\r\nthe interim.\nEver remain my friend, as much as I am yours,\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, August 11, 1810.\nMY DEAREST FRIEND,--\nNever was there a lovelier spring than this year;\r\nI say so, and feel it too, because it was then I first\r\nknew you. You have yourself seen that in society\r\nI am like a fish on the sand, which writhes and\r\nwrithes, but cannot get away till some benevolent\r\nGalatea casts it back into the mighty ocean. I was\r\nindeed fairly stranded, dearest friend, when surprised\r\nby you at a moment in which moroseness had\r\nentirely mastered me; but how quickly it vanished\r\nat your aspect! I was at once conscious that you\r\ncame from another sphere than this absurd world,\r\nwhere, with the best inclinations, I cannot open my\r\nears. I am a wretched creature, and yet I complain\r\nof others!! You will forgive this from the\r\ngoodness of heart that beams in your eyes, and the\r\ngood sense manifested by your ears; at least they\r\nunderstand how to flatter, by the mode in which\r\nthey listen. My ears are, alas! a partition-wall,\r\nthrough which I can with difficulty hold any intercourse\r\nwith my fellow-creatures. Otherwise, perhaps,\r\nI might have felt more assured with you; but\r\nI was only conscious of the full, intelligent glance\r\nfrom your eyes, which affected me so deeply that\r\nnever can I forget it. My dear friend! dearest\r\ngirl!--Art! who comprehends it? with whom can\r\nI discuss this mighty goddess? How precious to\r\nme were the few days when we talked together, or,\r\nI should rather say, corresponded! I have carefully\r\npreserved the little notes with your clever,\r\ncharming, most charming answers; so I have to\r\nthank my defective hearing for the greater part of\r\nour fugitive intercourse being written down. Since\r\nyou left this I have had some unhappy hours,--hours\r\nof the deepest gloom, when I could do nothing.\r\nI wandered for three hours in the Sch\xc3\xb6nbrunn\r\nAll\xc3\xa9e after you left us, but no angel met me there\r\nto take possession of me as you did. Pray forgive,\r\nmy dear friend, this deviation from the original key,\r\nbut I must have such intervals as a relief to my\r\nheart. You have no doubt written to Goethe\r\nabout me? I would gladly bury my head in a\r\nsack, so that I might neither see nor hear what goes\r\non in the world, because I shall meet you there no\r\nmore; but I shall get a letter from you? Hope\r\nsustains me, as it does half the world; through life\r\nshe has been my close companion, or what would\r\nhave become of me? I send you "Kennst Du das\r\nLand," written with my own hand, as a remembrance\r\nof the hour when I first knew you; I send\r\nyou also another that I composed since I bade you\r\nfarewell, my dearest, fairest sweetheart!\n\r\nHerz, mein Herz, was soll das geben,\r\nWas bedr\xc3\xa4nget dich so sehr;\r\nWelch ein neues fremdes Leben,\r\nIch erkenne dich nicht mehr.\r\n\nNow answer me, my dearest friend, and say what\r\nis to become of me since my heart has turned such\r\na rebel. Write to your most faithful friend,\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Feb. 10, 1811.\nDEAR AND BELOVED FRIEND,--\nI have now received two letters from you, while\r\nthose to Tonie show that you still remember me,\r\nand even too kindly. I carried your letter about\r\nwith me the whole summer, and it often made me\r\nfeel very happy; though I do not frequently write\r\nto you, and you never see me, still I write you letters\r\nby thousands in my thoughts. I can easily\r\nimagine what you feel at Berlin in witnessing all\r\nthe noxious frivolity of the world\'s rabble,[1] even\r\nhad you not written it to me yourself. Such prating\r\nabout art, and yet no results!!! The best description\r\nof this is to be found in Schiller\'s poem\r\n"Die Fl\xc3\xbcsse," where the river Spree is supposed to\r\nspeak. You are going to be married, my dear\r\nfriend, or are already so, and I have had no chance\r\nof seeing you even once previously. May all the\r\nfelicity that marriage ever bestowed on husband\r\nand wife attend you both! What can I say to you\r\nof myself? I can only exclaim with Johanna,\r\n"Compassionate my fate!" If I am spared for\r\nsome years to come, I will thank the Omniscient,\r\nthe Omnipotent, for the boon, as I do for all other\r\nweal and woe. If you mention me when you write\r\nto Goethe, strive to find words expressive of my\r\ndeep reverence and admiration. I am about to\r\nwrite to him myself with regard to "Egmont," for\r\nwhich I have written some music solely from my\r\nlove for his poetry, which always delights me. Who\r\ncan be sufficiently grateful to a great poet,--the\r\nmost precious jewel of a nation! Now no more, my\r\ndear sweet friend! I only came home this morning\r\nat four o\'clock from an orgy, where I laughed\r\nheartily, but to-day I feel as if I could weep as\r\nsadly; turbulent pleasures always violently recoil\r\non my spirits. As for Clemens [Brentano, her\r\nbrother], pray thank him for his complaisance;\r\nwith regard to the Cantata, the subject is not important\r\nenough for us here--it is very different in\r\nBerlin; and as for my affection, the sister engrosses\r\nso large a share, that little remains for the brother.\r\nWill he be content with this?\nNow farewell, my dear, dear friend; I imprint a\r\nsorrowful kiss on your forehead, thus impressing my\r\nthoughts on it as with a seal. Write soon, very\r\nsoon, to your brother,\nBEETHOVEN.\n1811.\nI am disposed to engage a man who has just offered\r\nme his services,--a music-copyist. His parents\r\nlive in Vienna, which might be convenient in many\r\nrespects, but I first wish to speak to you about the\r\nterms; and as you are disengaged to-morrow, which\r\nI, \nBEETHOVEN.\n1811.\nMOST HIGH-BORN OF MEN!--\nWe beg you to confer some goose-quills on us;\r\nwe will in return send you a whole bunch of the\r\nsame sort, that you may not be obliged to pluck out\r\nyour own. It is just possible that you may yet receive\r\nthe Grand Cross of the Order of the Violoncello.\r\nWe remain your gracious and most friendly\r\nof all friends,\nBEETHOVEN.\nThe Spring of 1811.\nYOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,--\nAs in spite of every effort I can find no copyist\r\nto write in my house, I send you my own manuscript;\r\nall you have to do is to desire Schlemmer\r\nto get you an efficient copyist, who must, however,\r\nwrite out the Trio in your palace, otherwise there\r\nwould be no security against piracy. I am better,\r\nand hope to have the honor of waiting on you in the\r\ncourse of a few days, when we must strive to make\r\nup for lost time. I always feel anxious and uneasy\r\nwhen I do not attend your Royal Highness as often\r\nor as assiduously as I wish. It is certainly the truth\r\nwhen I say that the loss is mine, but I trust I shall\r\nnot soon again be so unwell. Be graciously pleased\r\nto remember me; the time may yet come when I\r\nshall be able to show you doubly and trebly that\r\nI deserve this more than ever.\nI am your Royal Highness\'s devoted servant,\r\nLUDWIG V. BEETHOVEN.\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--[1]\nI have taken this trouble only that I might figure\r\ncorrectly, and thus be able sometimes to lead\r\nothers. As for mistakes, I scarcely ever required\r\nto have them pointed out to me, having had from\r\nmy childhood such a quick perception, that I exercised\r\nit unconscious that it ought to be so, or in fact\r\ncould be otherwise.\nJune 6, 1811.\nDEAR TREITSCHKE,--\nHave you read the book, and may I venture to\r\nhope that you will be persuaded to undertake it?\r\nBe so good as to give me an answer, as I am prevented\r\ngoing to you myself. If you have already\r\nread it, then send it back to me, that I may also\r\nlook over it again before you begin to work at it.\r\nAbove all, if it be your good pleasure that I should\r\nsoar to the skies on the wings of your poetry, I entreat\r\nyou to effect this as soon as possible.\nYour obedient servant,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nSept. 10, 1811.\nDEAR ZMESKALL,--\nLet the rehearsal stand over for the present. I\r\nmust see my doctor again to-day, of whose bungling\r\nI begin to tire. Thanks for your metronome; let\r\nus try whether we can measure Time into Eternity\r\nwith it, for it is so simple and easily managed that\r\nthere seems to be no impediment to this! In the\r\nmean time we will have a conference on the subject.\r\nThe mathematical precision of clockwork is of\r\ncourse greater; yet formerly, in watching the little\r\nexperiments you made in my presence, I thought\r\nthere was something worthy of notice in your metronome,\r\nand I hope we shall soon succeed in setting\r\nit thoroughly right. Ere long I hope to see you.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nOct. 26, 1811.\nI shall be at the "Swan" to-day, and hope to\r\nmeet you there to a certainty, but don\'t come too\r\nlate. My foot is better; the author of so many\r\npoetical feet promises the head author a sound foot\r\nwithin a week\'s time.\nNov. 20, 1811.\nWe are deucedly obliged to you. We beg you\r\nto be careful not to lose your well-earned fame.\r\nYou are exhorted to pursue the same course, and\r\nwe remain once more your deucedly attached\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nJan. 19, 1812.\nI shall be at the "Swan" to-day, dear Z. I\r\nhave, alas! too much leisure, and you none! Your\nBEETHOVEN.\n1812.\nCONFOUNDED LITTLE QUONDAM MUSICAL COUNT!\nWhat the deuce has become of you? Are you\r\nto be at the "Swan" to-day? No? ... Yes! See\r\nfrom this enclosure what I have done for Hungary.\r\nWhen a German undertakes a thing, even without\r\npledging his word, he acts very differently from\r\none of those Hungarian Counts, such as B. [Brunswick],\r\nwho allowed me to travel by myself--from\r\nwhat paltry, miserable motive who can tell?--and\r\nkept me waiting, though he did not wait for me!\nMy excellent little quondam musical Count,\nI am now, as ever, your attached\r\nBEETH\xc3\x96VERL.\nReturn the enclosure, for we wish to bring it,\r\nand something else, pretty forcibly under the notice\r\nof the Count.\nYou are summoned to appear to-day at the\r\n"Swan;" Brunswick also comes. If you do not appear,\r\nyou are henceforth excluded from all that concerns\r\nus. Excuses per excellentiam cannot be accepted.\r\nObedience is enjoined, knowing that we are\r\nacting for your benefit, and that our motive is to\r\nguard you against temptations and faithlessness per\r\nexcellentiam--dixi.\nBEETHOVEN.\nDEAR ZMESKALL,--\nThe well-known watchmaker who lives close to\r\nthe Freiung is to call on you. I want a first-rate\r\nrepeater, for which he asks forty ducats. As you\r\nlike that kind of thing, I beg you will exert yourself\r\non my behalf, and select a really good watch\r\nfor me.\nWith the most enthusiastic admiration for a man\r\nlike yourself, who is soon to give me an opportunity\r\nof displaying in his favor my particular knowledge\r\nof horn-playing, I am your\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1812.\nIf the wish to benefit the poor were not so evident\r\nin your letter, I should have felt not a little\r\noffended by your accompanying your request to\r\nme by the offer of payment. From my childhood,\r\nwhenever my art could be serviceable to poor suffering\r\nhumanity, I have never allowed any other motive\r\nto influence me, and never required anything\r\nbeyond the heartfelt gratification that it always\r\ncaused me. With this you will receive an Oratorio--(A),\r\nthe performance of which occupies half an\r\nevening, also an Overture and a Fantasia with Chorus--(B).\r\nIf in your benevolent institution you\r\npossess a d\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t for such things, I beg you will deposit\r\nthese three works there, as a mark of my sympathy\r\nfor the destitute; to be considered as their property,\r\nand to be given at any concerts intended for\r\ntheir sole benefit. In addition to these, you will\r\nreceive an Introduction to the "Ruins of Athens,"\r\nthe score of which shall be written out for you as\r\nsoon as possible. Likewise a Grand Overture to\r\n"Ungarn\'s erste Wohlth\xc3\xa4ter" [Hungary\'s First\r\nBenefactors].\nBoth form part of two works that I wrote for the\r\nHungarians at the opening of their new theatre [in\r\nPesth]. Pray give me, however, your written assurance\r\nthat these works shall not be performed\r\nelsewhere, as they are not published, nor likely to\r\nbe so for some time to come. You shall receive\r\nthe latter Grand Overture as soon as it is returned\r\nto me from Hungary, which it will be in the course\r\nof a few days.\nThe engraved Fantasia with Chorus could no\r\ndoubt be executed by a lady, an amateur, mentioned\r\nto me here by Professor Schneller.[2] The\r\nwords after the Chorus No. 4, in C major, were\r\naltered by the publishers, and are now quite contrary\r\nto the musical expression; those written in\r\npencil, therefore, on the music must be sung. If\r\nyou can make use of the Oratorio, I can send you\r\nall the parts written out, so that the outlay may be\r\nless for the poor. Write to me about this.\nYour obedient\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nFeb. 2, 1812.\nBy no means extraordinary, but very ordinary\r\nmender of pens! whose talent has failed on this occasion\r\n(for those I send require to be fresh mended),\r\nwhen do you intend at last to cast off your fetters?--when?\r\nYou never for a moment think of me;\r\naccursed to me is life amid this Austrian barbarism.\r\nI shall go now chiefly to the "Swan," as in other\r\ntaverns I cannot defend myself against intrusion.\r\nFarewell! that is, fare as well as I wish you to do\r\nwithout\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nMost wonderful of men! We beg that your\r\nservant will engage a person to fit up my apartment;\r\nas he is acquainted with the lodgings, he\r\ncan fix the proper price at once. Do this soon,\r\nyou Carnival scamp!!!!!!!\nThe enclosed note is at least a week old.\nFeb. 8, 1812.\nMost extraordinary and first and foremost man\r\nof the pendulum in the world, and without a lever\r\ntoo!!!\nI am much indebted to you for having imparted\r\nto me some share of your motive power. I wish to\r\nexpress my gratitude in person, and therefore invite\r\nyou this morning to come to the "Swan,"--a tavern,\r\nthe name of which itself shows that it is a fitting\r\nplace when such a subject is in question,\nYours ever,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Feb. 8, 1812.\nHerr Rettich has already got the parts of the\r\nOratorio, and when you no longer require them I\r\nbeg you will send them back to me. It is not\r\nprobable that anything is wanting, but even in that\r\ncase, as you have the score, you can easily remedy\r\nthis. I only yesterday received the Overtures from\r\nHungary, and shall have them copied and forwarded\r\nto you as soon as possible. I likewise send a March\r\nwith a vocal Chorus, also from the "Ruins of\r\nAthens." Altogether you will now have sufficient\r\nto fill up the time.\nAs these pieces are only in manuscript, I shall let\r\nyou know at the time I send them what precautions\r\nI wish you to take with regard to the Overtures\r\nand the March with Chorus.\nAs I do not publish any new work until a year\r\nafter its composition, and, when I do so, am obliged\r\ninvariably to give a written assurance to the publisher\r\nthat no one is in possession of it, you can\r\nyourself perceive that I must carefully guard against\r\nany possible contingency or casualty as to these\r\npieces. I must, however, assure you that I shall\r\nalways be disposed to show the warmest zeal in aid\r\nof your charity, and I here pledge myself to send\r\nyou every year works that exist solely in manuscript,\r\nor compositions written expressly for this\r\ncharitable purpose. I beg you will also let me know\r\nwhat your future plans are with regard to your\r\ninstitution, that I may act accordingly.\nFarewell! I remain, with the highest consideration,\nYour obedient\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nFeb. 19, 1812.\nDEAR Z.,--\nI only yesterday received the written information\r\nthat the Archduke pays his share in the new\r\npaper-money of the full value [Einl\xc3\xb6sungsschein].\r\nI beg you will write out for me, as nearly as you\r\ncan, the substance of what you said on Sunday, and\r\nwhich we thought it advisable to send to the other\r\ntwo. I am offered a certificate that the Archduke\r\nis to pay in Einl\xc3\xb6sungsschein, but I think this unnecessary,\r\nmore especially as the people about\r\nCourt, in spite of all their apparent friendship for\r\nme, declare that my demands are not just!!!! O\r\nHeaven! aid me in enduring this! I am no Hercules,\r\nto help Atlas in carrying the world, or to\r\nstrive to do so in his place. It was only yesterday\r\nthat I heard the particulars of the handsome manner\r\nin which Baron von Kraft had judged and\r\nspoken of me to Zisius! But never mind, dear\r\nZ.! My endurance of these shameful attacks cannot\r\ncontinue much longer; persecuted art will\r\neverywhere find an asylum--Daedalus, though\r\nimprisoned in a labyrinth, found wings to carry him\r\naloft. Oh! I too shall find wings!\nYours ever,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nIf you have time, send me this morning the\r\ndraft of the memorial;--probably for nothing, and\r\nto receive nothing! so much time is already lost,\r\nand only to be kept in suspense by civil words!\nLent, 1812.\nIn spite of my anxiety to serve the cause of your\r\ncharity, I have been quite unable to do so. I have\r\nno copyist of my own to write for me as formerly,\r\nand the limited time renders it impossible for me to\r\ndo so myself; thus I am obliged to have recourse to\r\nstrangers as copyists. One of these promised to\r\nwrite out the Overtures, &c., &c., for you; but\r\nPassion Week intervening, when there are so many\r\nconcerts, prevented his being able to keep his word,\r\nin spite of every effort on my part. Even if the\r\nOvertures and the March with Chorus were transcribed,\r\nit would not be possible to send them by this\r\npost, and if we wait for the next, the music will arrive\r\ntoo late for Easter Sunday. Let me know if\r\nthere are any means you could adopt to gain a little\r\nmore time, or any chance opportunity of sending\r\nthese works to you, and I will do all that lies in my\r\npower to aid the cause of your charity.\nI am, with esteem, yours obediently,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1812.\nYOUR IMPERIAL HIGHNESS,--\nI was much vexed not to receive Y.I.H.\'s message\r\nto come to you till very late yesterday evening--indeed\r\nnearly at eleven o\'clock. Contrary\r\nto my usual custom, I did not go home at all during\r\nthe afternoon, the fine weather having tempted\r\nme to spend the whole afternoon in walking, and\r\nthe evening at the Banda, "auf der Wieden," and\r\nthus I was not aware of your wish till I returned\r\nhome. In the mean time, whenever Y.I.H. desires\r\nit, I am ready at any hour or moment to place\r\nmyself at your disposal. I therefore await your\r\ngracious commands.\nI am your Imperial Highness\'s most obedient\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1812.\nYOUR IMPERIAL HIGHNESS,--\nI was unable till to-day, when I leave my bed\r\nfor the first time, to answer your gracious letter.\r\nIt will be impossible for me to wait on you to-morrow,\r\nbut perhaps the day after. I have suffered\r\nmuch during the last few days, and I may say two-fold\r\nfrom not being in a condition to devote a great\r\npart of my time to you, according to my heartfelt\r\nwish. I hope now, however, to have cleared off\r\nall scores for spring and summer (I mean as to\r\nhealth).\nI am your Imperial Highness\'s most obedient\r\nservant,\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, May 8, 1812.\nSIR,--\nBeing still far from well, and much occupied, I\r\nhave been unable to reply to your letters. How in\r\nthe world did such an unfounded idea ever occur to\r\nyou as that I was displeased? It would certainly\r\nhave been better had you returned the music as\r\nsoon as it had been performed; for at that period I\r\ncould have produced it here, whereas now, unluckily,\r\nit comes too late; but I only say unluckily because\r\nit prevents my being able to spare the worthy\r\nladies the expenses of copying. At any other time\r\nI would on no account have allowed them to pay\r\nfor writing out the works, but it so happens that at\r\nthis moment I am visited with every kind of contretemps,\r\nso I cannot avoid doing so. Possibly Herr\r\nO., although with the best intentions, has delayed\r\ninforming you of this, which obliged me to apply to\r\nhim for repayment of the expenses of copying; perhaps,\r\ntoo, in my haste, I did not express myself distinctly.\r\nYou can now, esteemed sir, have the Overture\r\nand the Chorus again if you require them.\nI feel convinced that in any event you will prevent\r\nmy confidence being abused; in the mean time\r\nyou may keep the Overture on the conditions I\r\nhave stated. If I find that I am able to pay for\r\nthe copying, I will redeem it for my own use.\nThe score of the Oratorio is a gift, and also the\r\nOverture to "Egmont." Keep the parts of the\r\nOratorio beside you till you can have it performed.\nSelect whatever you choose for the concert which\r\nI hear you now intend to give, and if you decide on\r\nthe Chorus and the Overture, they shall be forwarded\r\nto you at once. For the future concert, for\r\nthe benefit of the venerable Ursulines, I promise\r\nyou an entirely new symphony at all events, and\r\nperhaps also a work of some importance for voices,\r\nand as I have now a favorable opportunity, the\r\ncopying shall not cost you a farthing. My joy\r\nwould be beyond all bounds if the concert were to\r\nbe successful, and I could spare you all expense;--at\r\nall events, take my good-will for granted.\nRemember me to the admirable teachers of the\r\nchildren, and say to them that I shed tears of joy\r\nat the happy result of my poor good-will, and that\r\nso far as my humble capabilities can serve them,\r\nthey shall always find in me the warmest sympathy.\nMy cordial thanks for your invitation; I would\r\nfain become acquainted with the interesting scenery\r\nof Styria, and possibly I may one day enjoy that\r\npleasure. Farewell! I heartily rejoice in having\r\nfound in you a friend to the poor and needy, and\r\nam always yours to command.\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN, M.P.\n1812.\nThe most insignificant of mortals has just been\r\nto wait on his gracious master, when he found\r\neverything closed; so he came here, where indeed\r\nall was open, but no one to be found except the\r\ntrusty servant. I had a heavy packet of music with\r\nme, in order to ensure a good musical evening before\r\nwe parted; but in vain. Malfatti[2] is resolved\r\nthat I shall go to T\xc3\xb6plitz, which is anything but\r\nagreeable to me. As, however, I must obey, I\r\nhope at least that my gracious master will not enjoy\r\nhimself quite so much without me. O vanitas!\r\nfor it is nothing else. Before I set off for T\xc3\xb6plitz\r\nI will either go to Baden to see you or write.\r\nFarewell! Pray present my homage to my gracious\r\nmaster, and continue your regard for\nYour friend,\r\n[K.] BEETHOVEN.\nT\xc3\xb6plitz, July 19, 1812.\nMy thanks have been too long delayed for all the\r\ndainties which the worthy ladies sent for my enjoyment;\r\nbeing constantly ill in Vienna, I was at last\r\nforced to take refuge here.\nHowever, better late than never; so I beg you\r\nwill say all sorts of kind things in my name to the\r\nadmirable Ursuline ladies, though I did not deserve\r\nso much gratitude; indeed it is rather for me to\r\nthank Him who enables me to render my art occasionally\r\nuseful to others. When you next wish to\r\nmake use of my poor abilities for the benefit of the\r\nvenerable ladies, you have only to write to me.\nA new symphony is now ready for you, and as\r\nthe Archduke Rudolph has had it copied out, it will\r\ncost you nothing. Perhaps I may one of these\r\ndays be able to send you something vocal. I only\r\nwish and hope that you will not ascribe my anxiety\r\nto serve these venerable ladies to a certain degree\r\nof vanity or desire for fame, as this would grieve\r\nme exceedingly. If these good ladies wish to do\r\nme any service in return, I beg they will include\r\nme with their pupils in their pious orisons. I remain,\r\nwith esteem,\nYour friend,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nI shall remain here for some weeks; so if there is\r\nany occasion to write, address to me here.\nT\xc3\xb6plitz, August 8, 1812.\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN,\n\r\nWho even if you would,\r\nForget you never should.\r\n\nFranzensbrunn, Aug. 12, 1812.\nIt was my bounden duty long ago to have recalled\r\nmyself to Y.R.H.\'s recollection, but partly\r\nmy occupations and the state of my health, as well\r\nas my own insignificance, made me reluctant to\r\ndo so. I missed Y.R.H. by one night only in\r\nPrague; for when proceeding to pay my respects\r\nto you in the morning, I found you had set off the\r\nvery night before. In T\xc3\xb6plitz I heard a military\r\nband four times a day,--the only musical report\r\nwhich I can give you. I was a great deal with\r\nGoethe.[1] My physician Staudenheim, however,\r\nordered me off to Carlsbad,[2] and from thence here,\r\nand probably I shall have to go back to T\xc3\xb6plitz\r\nfrom this. What flights! And yet it seems very\r\ndoubtful whether any improvement in my condition\r\nhas hitherto taken place. I receive the best accounts\r\nof Y.R.H.\'s health, and also of the persistent\r\ndevotion you exhibit towards the musical\r\nMuse. Y.R.H. has no doubt heard of a concert\r\nthat I gave for the benefit of the sufferers by fire\r\nin the Stadt Baden,[3] assisted by Herr Polledro.[4]\r\nThe receipts were nearly 1000 florins W.W., and\r\nif I had not been restricted in my arrangements we\r\nmight easily have taken 2000 florins. It was literally\r\na poor concert for the poor. I could only\r\nfind at the publisher\'s here some of my earlier\r\nsonatas with violin accompaniments, and as Polledro\r\nhad set his heart on these, I was obliged to\r\ncontent myself with playing an old Sonata.[5] The\r\nentire concert consisted of a trio, in which Polledro\r\nplayed, my Sonata with violin, then again\r\nsomething was played by Polledro, and, lastly, I\r\nextemporized. Meanwhile I do sincerely rejoice\r\nthat by this means something has fallen to the share\r\nof the poor Badeners. Pray deign to accept my\r\nbest wishes for your welfare, and my entreaty that\r\nyou will sometimes think of me.\n[K.]\nT\xc3\xb6plitz, August 15, 1812.\nMY MOST DEAR KIND FRIEND,--\nKings and princes can indeed create professors\r\nand privy-councillors, and confer titles and decorations,\r\nbut they cannot make great men,--spirits\r\nthat soar above the base turmoil of this world.\r\nThere their powers fail, and this it is that forces\r\nthem to respect us.[1] When two persons like\r\nGoethe and myself meet, these grandees cannot\r\nfail to perceive what such as we consider great.\r\nYesterday, on our way home, we met the whole\r\nImperial family; we saw them coming some way\r\noff, when Goethe withdrew his arm from mine, in\r\norder to stand aside; and, say what I would, I could\r\nnot prevail on him to make another step in advance.\r\nI pressed down my hat more firmly on my head,\r\nbuttoned up my great-coat, and, crossing my arms\r\nbehind me, I made my way through the thickest\r\nportion of the crowd. Princes and courtiers formed\r\na lane for me; Archduke Rudolph took off his hat,\r\nand the Empress bowed to me first. These great\r\nones of the earth know me. To my infinite amusement,\r\nI saw the procession defile past Goethe, who\r\nstood aside with his hat off, bowing profoundly.\r\nI afterwards took him sharply to task for this; I\r\ngave him no quarter, and upbraided him with all\r\nhis sins, especially towards you, my dear friend, as\r\nwe had just been speaking of you. Heavens! if I\r\ncould have lived with you as he did, believe me I\r\nshould have produced far greater things. A musician\r\nis also a poet, he too can feel himself transported\r\ninto a brighter world by a pair of fine eyes,\r\nwhere loftier spirits sport with him and impose\r\nheavy tasks on him. What thoughts rushed into\r\nmy mind when I first saw you in the Observatory\r\nduring a refreshing May shower, so fertilizing to\r\nme also![2] The most beautiful themes stole from\r\nyour eyes into my heart, which shall yet enchant\r\nthe world when Beethoven no longer directs. If\r\nGod vouchsafes to grant me a few more years of\r\nlife, I must then see you once more, my dear, most\r\ndear friend, for the voice within, to which I always\r\nlisten, demands this. Spirits may love one another,\r\nand I shall ever woo yours. Your approval is\r\ndearer to me than all else in the world. I told\r\nGoethe my sentiments as to the influence praise\r\nhas over men like us, and that we desire our equals\r\nto listen to us with their understanding. Emotion\r\nsuits women only; (forgive me!) music ought to\r\nstrike fire from the soul of a man. Ah! my dear\r\ngirl, how long have our feelings been identical on\r\nall points!!! The sole real good is some bright\r\nkindly spirit to sympathize with us, whom we\r\nthoroughly comprehend, and from whom we need\r\nnot hide our thoughts. He who wishes to appear\r\nsomething, must in reality be something. The world\r\nmust acknowledge us, it is not always unjust; but\r\nfor this I care not, having a higher purpose in view.\r\nI hope to get a letter from you in Vienna; write\r\nto me soon and fully, for a week hence I shall be\r\nthere. The Court leaves this to-morrow, and to-day\r\nthey have another performance. The Empress\r\nhas studied her part thoroughly. The Emperor\r\nand the Duke wished me to play some of my own\r\nmusic, but I refused, for they are both infatuated\r\nwith Chinese porcelain. A little indulgence is required,\r\nfor reason seems to have lost its empire;\r\nbut I do not choose to minister to such perverse\r\nfolly--I will not be a party to such absurd doings\r\nto please those princes who are constantly guilty\r\nof eccentricities of this sort. Adieu! adieu! dear\r\none; your letter lay all night next my heart, and\r\ncheered me. Musicians permit themselves great\r\nlicense. Heavens! how I love you! Your most\r\nfaithful friend and deaf brother,\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Dec. 30, 1812.\nYOUR HIGHNESS,--\nThe dreadful event which deprived you of your\r\nhusband, Prince von Kinsky, snatching him from\r\nhis father-land and from all those who love him,[1] as\r\nwell as from many whom he generously supported,\r\nfilling every heart capable of appreciating goodness\r\nand greatness with the deepest sorrow, affected me\r\nalso in the most profound and painful degree. The\r\nstern duty of self-interest compels me to lay before\r\nyour Highness a humble petition, the reasonable\r\npurport of which may, I hope, plead my excuse for\r\nintruding on your Highness at a time when so\r\nmany affairs of importance claim your attention.\r\nPermit me to state the matter to your Highness.\nY.H. is no doubt aware that when I received a\r\nsummons to Westphalia in the year 1809, his Highness\r\nPrince von Kinsky, your late husband, together\r\nwith his I.H. Archduke Rudolph and H.H. the\r\nPrince von Lobkowitz, offered to settle on me for\r\nlife an annual income of 4000 gulden, provided I\r\ndeclined the proposal in question, and determined to\r\nremain in Austria. Although this sum was by no\r\nmeans in proportion to that secured to me in Westphalia,\r\nstill my predilection for Austria, as well as\r\nmy sense of this most generous proposal, induced me\r\nto accept it without hesitation. The share contributed\r\nby H.H. Prince Kinsky consisted of 1800\r\nflorins, which I have received by quarterly instalments\r\nsince 1809 from the Prince\'s privy purse.\r\nThough subsequent occurrences partially diminished\r\nthis sum, I rested satisfied, till the appearance\r\nof the Finance Patent, reducing bank-notes into\r\nEinl\xc3\xb6sung Schein. I applied to H.I.H. the\r\nArchduke Rudolph to request that the portion of\r\nthe annuity contributed by H.I.H. should in\r\nfuture be paid in Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein. This was at\r\nonce granted, and I received a written assurance\r\nto that effect from H.I.H. Prince von Lobkowitz\r\nagreed to the same with regard to his share,--700\r\nflorins [see No. 84]. H.H. Prince von Kinsky\r\nbeing at that time in Prague, I addressed my respectful\r\npetition to him last May, through Herr\r\nVarnhagen von Ense, an officer in the Vogelsang\r\nRegiment, that his Highness\'s contribution to my\r\nsalary--1800 florins--should be paid like the\r\nrest in Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein. Herr von Varnhagen\r\nwrote as follows, and the original of the letter is\r\nstill extant:--\n"I had yesterday the desired interview with\r\nPrince Kinsky. With the highest praise of Beethoven,\r\nhe at once acceded to his demand, and is\r\nprepared to pay up the arrears, and also all future\r\nsums from the date of the Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein, in\r\nthat currency. The cashier here has received the\r\nnecessary instructions, and Beethoven can draw for\r\nthe whole sum on his way through Prague, or, if\r\nhe prefers it, in Vienna, as soon as the Prince returns\r\nthere.\n"Prague, June 9, 1812."\nWhen passing through Prague some weeks\r\nafterwards, I took the opportunity of waiting on\r\nthe Prince, and received from him the fullest confirmation\r\nof this promise. H.H. likewise assured\r\nme that he entirely admitted the propriety of my\r\ndemand, and considered it quite reasonable. As I\r\ncould not remain in Prague till this affair was\r\nfinally settled, H.H. was so kind as to make me a\r\npayment of sixty ducats on account, which, according\r\nto H.H.\'s calculation, were good for 600 florins\r\nVienna currency. The arrears were to be paid up\r\non my return to Vienna, and an order given to the\r\ncashier to pay my salary in future in Einl\xc3\xb6sung\r\nSchein. Such was H.H.\'s pleasure. My illness\r\nincreasing in T\xc3\xb6plitz, I was obliged to remain there\r\nlonger than I originally intended. In the month\r\nof September I therefore addressed to H.H., who\r\nwas then in Vienna, through one of my friends\r\nhere, Herr Oliva, a written memorial, claiming his\r\npromise, when H.H. graciously repeated to this\r\nfriend the assurance he had already given me,\r\nadding that in the course of a few days he would\r\ngive the necessary instructions on the subject to his\r\ncashier.\nA short time afterwards he left Vienna. When\r\nI arrived there, I inquired from the Prince\'s secretary\r\nwhether H.H. had given directions about my\r\nsalary before leaving Vienna, when, to my surprise,\r\nI was told that H.H. had done nothing in the\r\nmatter.\nMy title to the liquidation of my claim is proved\r\nby the testimony of the Herren von Varnhagen\r\nand Oliva, to whom H.H. spoke on the subject,\r\nreiterating his consent. I feel convinced that the\r\nillustrious heirs and family of this prince will in\r\nthe same spirit of benevolence and generosity strive\r\nto fulfil his intentions. I therefore confidently\r\nplace in Y.H.\'s hands my respectful petition, viz.,\r\n"to pay up the arrears of my salary in Einl\xc3\xb6sung\r\nSchein, and to instruct your cashier to transmit me\r\nthe amount in future, in the same currency."\r\nRelying on your sense of justice according me a\r\nfavorable decision, I remain Y.H.\'s\nMost obedient servant,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1813.[1]\nI have been far from well since last Sunday,\r\nbut have suffered more in mind than in body. I\r\nbeg your forgiveness a thousand times for not\r\nhaving sooner sent my apologies; each day I had\r\nthe strongest inclination to wait on you, but Heaven\r\nknows that in spite of the best will that I always\r\nentertain for the best of masters I was unable to\r\ndo so, distressing as it is to me not to have it in my\r\npower to sacrifice all to him for whom I cherish\r\nthe highest esteem, love, and veneration. Y.R.H.\r\nwould perhaps act wisely in making a pause at\r\npresent with the Lobkowitz concerts; even the\r\nmost brilliant talent may lose its effect by too great\r\nfamiliarity.\n[K.]\n1813.[1]\nAt early dawn to-morrow the copyist shall begin\r\nthe last movement. As I am in the mean time\r\nwriting several other works, I did not hurry myself\r\nmuch with this last movement merely for the sake\r\nof punctuality, especially as I must write this more\r\ndeliberately, with a view to Rode\'s[2] playing; we\r\nlike quick, full-toned passages in our Finales, which\r\ndo not suit R., and this rather cramps me. At all\r\nevents, all is sure to go well next Tuesday. I very\r\nmuch doubt whether I shall be able to present myself\r\nat Y.R.H.\'s on that evening, in spite of my\r\nzeal in your service; but to make up for this, I\r\nmean to come to you to-morrow forenoon and to-morrow\r\nafternoon, that I may entirely fulfil the\r\nwishes of my illustrious pupil.\n[K.]\n1813.\nI had just gone out yesterday when your gracious\r\nletter reached me. As for my health, it is\r\npretty much the same, particularly as moral causes\r\naffect it, which do not seem likely to be removed;\r\nparticularly as I can have recourse to no one but\r\nmyself for aid, and can find help in my own head\r\nalone; and more particularly still, because in these\r\ndays neither words, nor honor, nor written pledges,\r\nseem binding on any one. As for my occupations,\r\nI have come to an end with some of them, and,\r\neven without your gracious invitation, I intended\r\nto appear at the usual hour to-day. With regard\r\nto Rode [see No. 96], I beg Y.R.H. to be so\r\ngood as to let me have the part by the bearer of\r\nthis, and I will send it to him at once, with a polite\r\nnote from me. He certainly will not take amiss\r\nmy sending him the part. Oh! certainly not!\r\nWould to Heaven that I were obliged to ask his forgiveness\r\non this account! for in that case things\r\nwould really be in a better position. Is it your pleasure\r\nthat I should come to you this evening at five\r\no\'clock as usual, or does Y.R.H. desire another\r\nhour? I shall endeavor to arrange accordingly, and\r\npunctually to fulfil your wishes.\n[K.]\nVienna, Feb. 12, 1813.\nYOUR HIGHNESS!--\nYou were so gracious as to declare with regard\r\nto the salary settled on me by your deceased husband,\r\nthat you saw the propriety of my receiving\r\nit in Vienna currency, but that the authority of the\r\ncourt of law which has assumed the guardianship\r\nof the estate must first be obtained. Under the\r\nconviction that the authorities who represent their\r\nprincely wards could not fail to be influenced by\r\nthe same motives that actuated the late Prince in\r\nhis conduct towards me, I think I am justified in\r\nexpecting the ratification of my claim from the\r\naforesaid court, as I can prove, by the testimony of\r\nwell-known, respectable, and upright men, the promise\r\nand intentions of H.H. in my behalf, which\r\ncannot fail to be binding on his heirs and children.\r\nIf, therefore, the proofs submitted should even be\r\nfound deficient in legal formality, I cannot doubt\r\nthat this want will be supplied by the noble mode\r\nof thinking of this illustrious house, and by their\r\nown inclination to generous actions.\nPossibly another question may at present arise\r\nfrom the condition of the inheritance, which is no\r\ndoubt heavily burdened, both owing to the melancholy\r\nand sudden death of the late Prince, and by\r\nthe state of the times, which renders it equally\r\njust and indispensable to husband carefully all possible\r\nresources. On this account it is far from my\r\nwish to claim more than is absolutely necessary for\r\nmy own livelihood, and grounded on the contract\r\nitself,--the legality of such a claim on the heirs of\r\nthe late Prince not being in any way disputed.\nI beg, then, that Y.H. will be pleased to direct\r\nthe arrears of my salary, due since the 1st September,\r\n1811, calculated in Vienna currency, in accordance\r\nwith the scale of the contract, making in\r\nW.W. 1088 florins 42 kreuzers, to be paid, and in\r\nthe interim, the question whether this salary ought\r\nto be paid in Vienna currency can be deferred until\r\nthe affairs are settled, when the subject is again\r\nbrought before the trustees, and my claims admitted\r\nto be just by their consent and authority. The\r\nlate Prince having given me sixty ducats merely\r\non account of my salary, which was to be paid by\r\nagreement in Vienna currency, and as this agreement\r\n(as every intelligent man will inform Y.H.)\r\nmust be accepted to its full extent, or at all events\r\nnot cause me loss, it follows as a matter of course\r\nthat Y.H. will not object to my considering the\r\nsixty ducats as only an instalment of the arrears\r\ndue to me beyond the usual scale of payment,\r\nagreed to be paid in Vienna currency, so that the\r\namount must not be deducted from the sum still\r\ndue to me.\nI feel sure that Y.H.\'s noble feelings will do justice\r\nto the equity of my proposal, and my wish to\r\nenter into every detail of this affair, so far as circumstances\r\npermit, and also my readiness to postpone\r\nmy claims to suit your convenience. The\r\nsame elevated sentiments which prompted you to\r\nfulfil the engagement entered into by the late\r\nPrince, will also make Y.H. apprehend the absolute\r\nnecessity entailed on me by my position again\r\nto solicit immediate payment of the arrears of my\r\nsalary, which are indispensable for my maintenance.\nAnxiously hoping for a favorable answer to my\r\npetition, I have the honor to remain, with profound\r\nrespect,\nY.R.H.\'s obedient servant,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nHIGHLY HONORED PRINCESS!--\nAs the Prince\'s counsel declared that my claim\r\ncould not be heard till the choice of a guardian had\r\nbeen made, and as I now hear that Y.H. has been\r\ngraciously pleased yourself to assume that office, but\r\ndecline receiving any one, I present my humble\r\npetition in writing, requesting at the same time\r\nyour early consideration; for you can easily understand\r\nthat, relying on a thing as a certainty, it is\r\npainful to be so long deprived of it, especially as I\r\nam obliged entirely to support an unfortunate sickly\r\nbrother and his whole family,[1] which (not computing\r\nmy own wants) has entirely exhausted my resources,\r\nhaving expected to provide for myself by\r\nthe payment of my salary. You may perceive the\r\njustice of my claims from the fact of my faithfully\r\nnaming the receipt of the sixty ducats, advanced to\r\nme by the late Prince in Prague, the Prince\'s counsel\r\nhimself declaring that I might have said nothing\r\nabout this sum, the late Prince not having mentioned\r\nit either to him or to his cashier.\nForgive my being obliged to intrude this affair\r\non you, but necessity compels me to do so. Some\r\ndays hence I shall take the liberty of making inquiries\r\non the subject from the Prince\'s counsel, or\r\nfrom any one Y.H. may appoint.\nI remain, most esteemed and illustrious Princess,\nYour devoted servant,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nDEAR Z.,--\nForward the accompanying letter to-day without\r\nfail to Brunswick, that it may arrive as soon and as\r\nsafely as possible. Excuse the trouble I give you.\r\nI have been again applied to, to send some of my\r\nworks to Gratz, in Styria, for a concert to be given\r\nin aid of the Ursuline convent and its schools: last\r\nyear they had very large receipts by this means.\r\nIncluding this concert, and one I gave in Carlsbad\r\nfor the benefit of the sufferers from fire at Baden,\r\nthree concerts have been given by me, and through\r\nme, for benevolent purposes in one year; and yet\r\nif I ask a favor, people are as deaf as a post. Your\nBEETHOVEN.\nI. Letter to Sclowonowitsch (Ma\xc3\xaetre des bureaux\r\ndes postes) in Cassel. I can no longer do without\r\nthe books of Tiedge and Frau von der Recke, as I\r\nam expected to give some opinion about them.\nMY GOOD SIR,--\nRode was not quite correct in all that he said of\r\nme; my health is not particularly good, and from\r\nno fault of my own,--my present condition being\r\nthe most unfortunate of my life. But neither this\r\nnor anything in the world shall prevent me from\r\nassisting, so far as it lies in my power, the innocent\r\nand distressed ladies of your convent by my poor\r\nworks. I therefore place at your disposal two new\r\nsymphonies, a bass aria with chorus, and several\r\nminor choruses; if you desire again to perform\r\n"Hungaria\'s Benefactors," which you gave last\r\nyear, it is also at your service. Among the\r\nchoruses you will find a "Dervise Chorus," a capital\r\nbait for a mixed public.\nIn my opinion, your best plan would be to select\r\na day when you could give the "Mount of Olives,"\r\nwhich has been everywhere performed. This\r\nwould occupy one half of the concert, and the other\r\nhalf might consist of a new symphony, the overtures,\r\nand various choruses, and likewise the above-named\r\nbass aria and chorus; thus the evening\r\nwould not be devoid of variety. But you can settle\r\nall this more satisfactorily with the aid of your\r\nown musical authorities. I think I can guess what\r\nyou mean about a gratuity for me from a third person.\r\nWere I in the same position as formerly, I\r\nwould at once say, "Beethoven never accepts anything\r\nwhere the benefit of humanity is concerned;"\r\nbut owing to my own too great benevolence I am\r\nreduced to a low ebb, the cause of which, however,\r\ndoes not put me to shame, being combined with\r\nother circumstances for which men devoid of honor\r\nand principle are alone to blame; so I do not hesitate\r\nto say that I would not refuse the contribution\r\nof the rich man to whom you allude.[1] But there\r\nis no question here of any claim. If, however, the\r\naffair with the third person comes to nothing, pray\r\nrest assured that I shall be equally disposed to confer\r\nthe same benefit as last year on my friends the\r\nrespected Ursuline ladies, and shall at all times be\r\nready to succor the poor and needy so long as I\r\nlive. And now farewell! Write soon, and I will\r\nzealously strive to make all necessary arrangements.\r\nMy best wishes for the convent.\nI am, with esteem, your friend,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nMY EXCELLENT V. [VARENNA],--\nI received your letter with much pleasure, but\r\nwith much displeasure the 100 florins allotted to me\r\nby our poor convent ladies; in the mean time I will\r\napply part of this sum to pay the copyists--the surplus\r\nand the accounts for copying shall be sent to\r\nthese good ladies.\nI never accept anything for such a purpose. I\r\nthought that perhaps the third person to whom you\r\nalluded might be the Ex-King of Holland, in which\r\ncase I should have had no scruples, under my present\r\ncircumstances, in accepting a gratuity from him,\r\nwho has no doubt taken enough from the Dutch in\r\na less legitimate way; but as it is, I must decline\r\n(though in all friendship) any renewal of this subject.\nLet me know whether, were I to come myself to\r\nGratz, I could give a concert, and what the receipts\r\nwould probably be; for Vienna, alas! can no longer\r\ncontinue my place of abode. Perhaps it is now too\r\nlate? but any information from you on the point\r\nwill be very welcome.\nThe works are being copied, and you shall have\r\nthem as soon as possible. You may do just what\r\nyou please with the Oratorio; where it will be of\r\nmost use it will best fulfil my intentions.\nI am, with esteem, your obedient\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nP.S. Say all that is kind from me to the worthy\r\nUrsuline ladies. I rejoice in being able to serve\r\nthem.\nConfounded, invited guest! Domanowetz!--not\r\nmusical Count, but gobbling Count! dinner Count!\r\nsupper Count! &c., &c. The Quartet is to be tried\r\nover to-day at ten o\'clock or half-past, at Lobkowitz\'s.[1]\r\nHis Highness, whose wits are generally\r\nastray, is not yet arrived; so pray join us, if you can\r\nescape from your Chancery jailer. Herzog is to see\r\nyou to-day. He intends to take the post of my\r\nman-servant; you may agree to give him thirty\r\nflorins, with his wife obbligata. Firing, light, and\r\nmorning livery found. I must have some one who\r\nknows how to cook, for if my food continues as bad\r\nas it now is, I shall always be ill. I dine at home\r\nto-day, because I get better wine. If you will only\r\norder what you like, I very much wish you to come\r\nto me. You shall have the wine gratis, and of far\r\nbetter quality than what you get at the scoundrelly\r\n"Swan."\nYour very insignificant\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nFeb. 25, 1813.\nI have been constantly indisposed, dear Zmeskall,\r\nsince I last saw you; in the mean time the servant\r\nwho lived with you before your present one has applied\r\nfor my situation. I do not recollect him, but\r\nhe told me he had been with you, and that you had\r\nnothing to say against him, except that he did not\r\ndress your hair as you wished. I gave him earnest-money,\r\nthough only a florin. Supposing you have\r\nno other fault to find with the man (and if so I beg\r\nyou will candidly mention it), I intend to engage\r\nhim, for you know that it is no object with me to\r\nhave my hair dressed; it would be more to the purpose\r\nif my finances could be dressed, or re-dressed.\r\nI hope to get an answer from you to day. If there\r\nis no one to open the door to your servant, let him\r\nleave the note in the entrance to the left, and should\r\nhe find no one there either, he must give it to the\r\nporter\'s wife below stairs. May Heaven prosper\r\nyou in your musical undertakings! Your\nBEETHOVEN,\nMiserabilis.\nFeb. 28, 1813.\nLet us leave things as they are for to-day, dear\r\nZ., till we meet [and so on about the servant].\nFarewell! Carefully guard the fortresses of the\r\nrealm, which, as you know, are no longer virgins,\r\nand have already received many a shot.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nMOST WORTHY COUNSELLOR, OWNER OF MINES AND LORD OF FASTNESSES\r\nIN BURGUNDY AND BUDA!--\nBe so good as to let me know how matters stand,\r\nas this afternoon at latest I shall take advantage of\r\nyour reply to my question, by giving my servant\r\nwarning for this day fortnight. His wages, &c., &c.\r\n[The rest relates to his servant.]\nApril 19, 1813.\nMY DEAR ZMESKALL,--\nI have been refused the University Hall. I\r\nheard this two days since; but being indisposed\r\nyesterday I could not go to see you, nor can I\r\nto-day either. We have no resource now but the\r\nK\xc3\xa4rnthnerthor Theatre, or the one "an der Wien."\r\nI believe there will only be one concert. If both\r\nthese fail, we must then have recourse to the Augarten,\r\nin which case we ought certainly to give two\r\nconcerts. Reflect on this, my dear friend, and let\r\nme have your opinion. To-morrow the symphonies\r\nmay perhaps be tried over at the Archduke\'s if I\r\nam able to go out, of which I will apprise you.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nApril 23, 1813.\nDEAR Z.,--\nAll will go right, the Archduke being resolved\r\nto take this Prince Fizlypuzly roundly to task.\r\nLet me know if you are to dine at the tavern to-day,\r\nor where? Pray tell me if "Sentivany" is\r\nproperly spelt, as I wish to write to him at the same\r\ntime about the Chorus. We must also consult together\r\nwhat day to choose. By the by, be cautious\r\nnot to mention the intercession of the Archduke,\r\nfor Prince Fizlypuzly is not to be with him till Sunday,\r\nand if that evil-minded creditor had any previous\r\nhint of the affair, he would still try to evade us.\nYours ever,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nApril 26, 1813.\nLobkowitz will give me a day on the 15th of\r\nMay, or after that period, which seems to me scarcely\r\nbetter than none at all; so I am almost disposed to\r\ngive up all idea of a concert. But the Almighty\r\nwill no doubt prevent my being utterly ruined.\nYours,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nBaden, May 27, 1813.\nI have the honor to inform you of my arrival in\r\nBaden, which is indeed still very empty of human\r\nbeings, but with all the greater luxuriance and full\r\nlustre does Nature shine in her enchanting loveliness.\r\nWhere I fail, or ever have failed, be graciously\r\nindulgent towards me, for so many trying\r\noccurrences, succeeding each other so closely, have\r\nreally almost bewildered me; still I am convinced\r\nthat the resplendent beauties of Nature here, and\r\nthe charming environs, will gradually restore my\r\nspirits, and a double share of tranquillity be my portion,\r\nas by my stay here I likewise fulfil the wishes\r\nof Y.R.H. Would that my desire soon to hear that\r\nY.R.H. is fully restored were equally fulfilled!\r\nThis is indeed my warmest wish, and how much I\r\ngrieve that I cannot at this moment contribute to\r\nyour recovery by means of my art! This is reserved\r\nfor the goddess Hygeia alone, and I, alas!\r\nam only a poor mortal, who commends himself to\r\nY.R.H., and sincerely hopes soon to be permitted\r\nto wait on you.\n[K.]\nVienna, July 24, 1813.\nFrom day to day I have been expecting to return\r\nto Baden; in the mean time, the discords that detain\r\nme here may possibly be resolved by the end of the\r\nensuing week. To me a residence in a town during\r\nthe summer is misery, and when I also remember\r\nthat I am thus prevented waiting on Y.R.H., it is\r\nstill more vexatious and annoying. It is, in fact,\r\nthe Lobkowitz and Kinsky affairs that keep me here.\r\nInstead of pondering over a number of bars, I am\r\nobliged constantly to reflect on the number of peregrinations\r\nI am forced to make; but for this, I could\r\nscarcely endure to the end. Y.R.H. has no doubt\r\nheard of Lobkowitz\'s misfortunes,[1] which are much\r\nto be regretted; but after all, to be rich is no such\r\ngreat happiness! It is said that Count Fries alone\r\npaid 1900 gold ducats to Duport, for which he had\r\nthe security of the ancient Lobkowitz house. The\r\ndetails are beyond all belief. I hear that Count Rasumowsky[2]\r\nintends to go to Baden, and to take his\r\nQuartet with him, which is really very pretty, and\r\nI have no doubt that Y.R.H. will be much pleased\r\nwith it. I know no more charming enjoyment in\r\nthe country than quartet music. I beg Y.R.H.\r\nwill accept my heartfelt wishes for your health, and\r\nalso compassionate me for being obliged to pass my\r\ntime here under such disagreeable circumstances.\r\nBut I will strive to compensate twofold in Baden\r\nfor what you have lost.\n[K.]\n1813.[1]\nI beg to inquire whether, being in some degree\r\nrestored, I am to wait on you this evening? I at\r\nthe same time take the liberty to make a humble\r\nrequest. I was in hopes that by this time, at all\r\nevents, my melancholy circumstances would have\r\nbrightened, but all continues in its old state, so I\r\nmust determine on giving two concerts.[2] I find\r\nthat I am compelled to give up my former resolution\r\nnever to give any except for benevolent purposes;\r\nas self-maintenance demands that I should\r\ndo so. The hall of the University would be the\r\nmost advantageous and distinguished for my present\r\nobject, and my humble request consists in entreating\r\nY.R.H. to be so gracious as to send a line to the\r\npresent Rector Magnificus of the University, through\r\nBaron Schweiger, which would certainly ensure my\r\ngetting the hall. In the hope of a favorable answer,\r\nI remain, &c., &c.\n[K.]\nLate in the Autumn of 1813.\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--\nI have to-day applied (by letter) to my gracious\r\nmaster to interest himself in procuring the University\r\nHall for two concerts which I think of giving,\r\nand in fact must give, for all remains as it was.\r\nAlways considering you, both in good and evil fortune,\r\nmy best friend, I suggested to the Duke that\r\nyou should apply in his name for this favor to the\r\npresent Rector of the University. Whatever may\r\nbe the result, let me know H.R.H.\'s decision as\r\nsoon as possible, that I may make further efforts to\r\nextricate myself from a position so detrimental to\r\nme and to my art. I am coming this evening to the\r\nArchduke.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\r\n[K.]\nDEAR SIR,--\nI request you will send me the parts of the Symphony\r\nin A, and likewise my score. His I.H. can\r\nhave the MS. again, but I require it at present for\r\nthe music in the Augarten to-morrow. I have just\r\nreceived two tickets, which I send to you, and beg\r\nyou will make use of them.\nI am, with esteem, yours,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nOct. 9, 1813.\nMY DEAR GOOD Z.,--\nDon\'t be indignant with me for asking you to\r\naddress the enclosed letter properly; the person for\r\nwhom it is intended is constantly complaining that\r\nhe gets no letters from me. Yesterday I took one\r\nmyself to the post-office, when I was asked where\r\nthe letter was meant to go. I see, therefore, that\r\nmy writing seems to be as little understood as myself.\r\nThence my request to you. Your\nBEETHOVEN.\nI esteem it my duty to express my gratitude for\r\nthe great zeal shown by all those artists who so\r\nkindly co\xc3\xb6perated on the 8th and 12th December\r\n[1813] in the concerts given for the benefit of the\r\nAustrian and Bavarian soldiers wounded at the\r\nbattle of Hanau. It was a rare combination of\r\neminent artists, where all were inspired by the\r\nwish to be of use to their father-land, and to contribute\r\nby the exercise of their talents to the fulfilment\r\nof the undertaking, while, regardless of\r\nall precedence, they gladly accepted subordinate\r\nplaces.[1] While an artist like Herr Schuppanzigh\r\nwas at the head of the first violins, and by his fiery\r\nand expressive mode of conducting kindled the zeal\r\nof the whole orchestra, Herr Kapellmeister Salieri\r\ndid not scruple to give the time to the drums and\r\ncannonades; Herr Spohr and Herr Mayseder, each\r\nworthy from his talents to fill the highest post,\r\nplayed in the second and third rank. Herr Siboni\r\nand Herr Giuliani also filled subordinate places.\r\nThe conducting of the whole was only assigned to\r\nme from the music being my own composition; had\r\nit been that of any one else, I would willingly, like\r\nHerr Hummel, have taken my place at the big\r\ndrum, as the only feeling that pervaded all our\r\nhearts was true love for our father-land, and the\r\nwish cheerfully to devote our powers to those who\r\nhad sacrificed so much for us. Particular thanks\r\nare due to Herr Maelzel, inasmuch as he first suggested\r\nthe idea of this concert, and the most\r\ntroublesome part of the enterprise, the requisite\r\narrangements, management, and regulations, devolved\r\non him. I more especially thank him for\r\ngiving me an opportunity by this concert of fulfilling\r\na wish I have long cherished, to compose for\r\nsuch a benevolent object (exclusive of the works\r\nalready made over to him) a comprehensive work\r\nmore adapted to the present times, to be laid on\r\nthe altar of my father-land.[2] As a notice is to be\r\npublished of all those who assisted on this occasion,\r\nthe public will be enabled to judge of the noble\r\nself-denial exercised by a mass of the greatest artists,\r\nworking together with the same benevolent object\r\nin view.\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1814.\nI beg you will send me the score of the "Final\r\nChorus"[2] for half a day, as the theatrical score is\r\nso badly written.\n[K.]\n1814.\nHaving only so recently received the score of\r\nthe "Final Chorus," I must ask you to excuse\r\nyour getting it back so late. The best thing H.R.H.\r\ncan do is to have it transcribed, for in its present\r\nform the score is of no use. I would have brought\r\nit myself, but I have been laid up with a cold since\r\nlast Sunday, which is most severe, and obliges me\r\nto be very careful, being so much indisposed. I\r\nnever feel greater satisfaction than when Y.R.H.\r\nderives any pleasure through me. I hope very soon\r\nto be able to wait on you myself, and in the mean\r\ntime I pray that you will keep me in remembrance.\n[K.]\n1814.\nThe song "Germania" belongs to the whole\r\nworld who sympathize with the subject, and to you\r\nbeyond all others, just as I myself am wholly yours.\r\nI wish you a good journey to Palermo.\n[K.]\nMarch, 1814.\nMY DEAR, WORTHY T.,--\nI have read with the greatest satisfaction your\r\namendments of the Opera ["Fidelio" which was\r\nabout to be again performed]. It has decided me\r\nonce more to rebuild the desolate ruins of an ancient\r\nfortress.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nThe affair of the Opera is the most troublesome\r\nin the world, and there is scarcely one part of it\r\nwhich quite satisfies me now, and that I have not\r\nbeen obliged to amend by something more satisfactory.\r\nBut what a difference between this, and\r\ngiving one\'s self up to freely flowing thought and\r\ninspiration!\n1814.\nI request, my dear T., that you will send me\r\nthe score of the song [in "Fidelio," Geld ist eine\r\nsch\xc3\xb6ne Sache], that the interpolated notes may be\r\ntranscribed in all the instrumental parts; though I\r\nshall not take it at all amiss if you prefer that\r\nGirowetz or any other person, perhaps Weinm\xc3\xbcller\r\n[who sang the part of Rocco], should do so. This\r\nI have nothing to say against, but I will not suffer\r\nmy composition to be altered by any one whatever,\r\nbe he who he may.\nI am, with high consideration,\r\nYour obedient\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nMY DEAR COUNT,--\nIf you wish to attend our council [about the alterations\r\nin "Fidelio"], I beg to inform you that\r\nit assembles this afternoon at half-past three o\'clock,\r\nin the Spielmann Haus, auf dem Graben, No. 188,\r\n4th Etage, at Herr Weinm\xc3\xbcller\'s. I shall be very\r\nglad if you have leisure to be present.\nMy dear, victorious, and yet sometimes nonplussed\r\n(?) Count! I hope that you rested well,\r\nmost precious and charming of all Counts! Oh!\r\nmost beloved and unparalleled Count! most fascinating\r\nand prodigious Count!\n\n\n\n(To be repeated at pleasure.)\nAt what hour shall we call on Walter to-day?\r\nMy going or not depends entirely on you. Your\nBEETHOVEN.\n1814.\nI hope you forgive me for not having come to\r\nyou. Your displeasure would be totally undeserved,\r\nand I will amply compensate for lost time in a few\r\ndays. My Opera of "Fidelio"[1] is again to be performed,\r\nwhich gives me a great deal to do; moreover,\r\nthough I look well, I am not so in reality.\r\nThe arrangements for my second concert[2] are\r\npartly completed. I must write something new for\r\nMdlle. Milder.[3] Meanwhile it is a consolation to\r\nme to hear that Y.R.H. is so much better. I\r\nhope I am not too sanguine in thinking that I shall\r\nsoon be able to contribute towards this. I have\r\ntaken the liberty to apprise my Lord Falstaff[4] that\r\nhe is ere long to have the honor of appearing before\r\nY.R.H.\n[K.]\nVienna, July 14, 1814.\nWhenever I inquire about you I hear nothing\r\nbut good news. As for my own insignificant self,\r\nI have been hitherto hopelessly detained in Vienna,\r\nand unable to approach Y.R.H.; I am also thus\r\ndeprived of the enjoyment of beautiful Nature, so\r\ndear to me. The directors of the theatre are so\r\nconscientious, that, contrary to their faithful promise,\r\nthey have again given my Opera of "Fidelio,"\r\nwithout thinking of giving me any share in the\r\nreceipts. They would have exhibited the same\r\ncommendable good faith a second time, had I not\r\nbeen on the watch like a French custom-house officer\r\nof other days. At last, after a great many\r\ntroublesome discussions, it was settled that the\r\nOpera of "Fidelio" should be given on Monday\r\nthe 18th of July, for my benefit. These receipts\r\nat this season of the year may more properly be\r\ncalled deceits; but if a work is in any degree successful\r\nit often becomes a little feast for the author.\r\nTo this feast the master invites his illustrious pupil,\r\nand hopes--yes! I hope that Y.R.H. will graciously\r\nconsent to come, and thus add lustre to\r\neverything by your presence. It would be a great\r\nboon if Y.R.H. would endeavor to persuade the\r\nother members of the Imperial family to be present\r\nat the representation of my Opera, and I on my\r\npart will not fail to take the proper steps on the\r\nsubject which duty commands. Vogl\'s illness[1] enabled\r\nme to satisfy my desire to give the part of\r\nPizarro to Forti,[2] his voice being better suited to\r\nit; but owing to this there are daily rehearsals,\r\nwhich cannot fail to have a favorable effect on the\r\nperformance, but which render it impossible for me\r\nto wait upon Y.R.H. before my benefit. Pray\r\ngive this letter your favorable consideration, and\r\nthink graciously of me.\n[K.]\n1814.\nI voluntarily presented Maelzel gratis with a\r\n"Battle Symphony" for his panharmonica. After\r\nhaving kept it for some time, he brought me back\r\nthe score, which he had already begun to engrave,\r\nsaying that he wished it to be harmonized for a full\r\norchestra. The idea of a battle had already occurred\r\nto me, which, however, could not be performed on\r\nhis panharmonica. We agreed to select this and\r\nsome more of my works [see No. 116] to be given\r\nat the concert for the benefit of disabled soldiers.\r\nAt that very time I became involved in the most\r\nfrightful pecuniary difficulties. Forsaken by every\r\none in Vienna, and in daily expectation of remittances,\r\n&c., Maelzel offered me fifty gold ducats,\r\nwhich I accepted, saying that I would either repay\r\nthem, or allow him to take the work to London,\r\n(provided I did not go there myself with him,)\r\nreferring him to an English publisher for payment.\nI got back from him the score written for the\r\npanharmonica. The concerts then took place, and\r\nduring that time Herr Maelzel\'s designs and character\r\nwere first fully revealed. Without my consent,\r\nhe stated on the bills of the concert that the work\r\nwas his property. Indignant at this, I insisted on\r\nhis destroying these bills. He then stated that I\r\nhad given it to him as a friendly act, because he\r\nwas going to London. To this I did not object,\r\nbelieving that I had reserved the right to state the\r\nconditions on which the work should be his own. I\r\nremember that when the bills were being printed,\r\nI violently opposed them, but the time was too\r\nshort, as I was still writing the work. In all the\r\nfire of inspiration, and absorbed in my composition,\r\nI scarcely thought at all on the subject. Immediately\r\nafter the first concert in the University Hall,\r\nI was told on all sides, and by people on whom I\r\ncould rely, that Maelzel had everywhere given out\r\nhe had paid me 400 gold ducats for the Symphony.\r\nI sent what follows to a newspaper, but the\r\neditor would not insert it, as Maelzel stands well\r\nwith them all. As soon as the first concert was\r\nover, I repaid Maelzel his fifty ducats, declaring that\r\nhaving discovered his real character, nothing should\r\never induce me to travel with him; justly indignant\r\nthat, without consulting me, he had stated in the bills\r\nthat all the arrangements for the concert were most\r\ndefective. His own despicable want of patriotism\r\ntoo is proved by the following expressions: "I care\r\nnothing at all about L.; if it is only said in London\r\nthat people have paid ten gulden for admission here,\r\nthat is all I care about; the wounded are nothing\r\nto me." Moreover, I told him that he might take\r\nthe work to London on certain conditions, which I\r\nwould inform him of. He then asserted that it was\r\na friendly gift, and made use of this phrase in the\r\nnewspapers after the second concert, without giving\r\nme the most remote hint on the subject. As Maelzel\r\nis a rude, churlish man, entirely devoid of education\r\nor cultivation, it is easy to conceive the tenor\r\nof his conduct to me during this time, which still\r\nfurther irritated me. Who could bear to be forced\r\nto bestow a friendly gift on such a man? I was\r\noffered an opportunity to send the work to the\r\nPrince Regent, [afterwards George IV.] It was\r\ntherefore quite impossible for me to give away the\r\nwork unconditionally.\nHe then called on a mutual friend to make proposals.\r\nHe was told on what day to return for an\r\nanswer, but he never appeared, set off on his travels,\r\nand performed the work in Munich. How did he\r\nobtain it? He could not possibly steal it; but Herr\r\nMaelzel had several of the parts for some days in\r\nhis house, and he caused the entire work to be harmonized\r\nby some obscure musical journeyman, and\r\nis now hawking it about the world. Herr Maelzel\r\npromised me ear-trumpets. I harmonized the\r\n"Battle Symphony" for his panharmonica from a\r\nwish to keep him to his word. The ear-trumpets\r\ncame at last, but were not of the service to me that\r\nI expected. For this slight trouble Herr Maelzel,\r\nafter my having arranged the "Battle Symphony"\r\nfor a full orchestra, and composed a battle-piece in\r\naddition, declared that I ought to have made over\r\nthese works to him as his own exclusive property.\r\nEven allowing that I am in some degree obliged to\r\nhim for the ear-trumpets, this is entirely balanced\r\nby his having made at least 500 gulden in Munich\r\nby my mutilated or stolen battle-piece. He has\r\ntherefore paid himself in full. He had actually the\r\naudacity to say here that he was in possession of the\r\nbattle-piece; in fact he showed it, written out, to\r\nvarious persons. I did not believe this; and, in\r\nfact, with good reason, as the whole is not by me,\r\nbut compiled by some one else. Indeed the credit\r\nhe assumes for the work should alone be sufficient\r\ncompensation.\nThe secretary at the War Office made no allusion\r\nwhatever to me, and yet every work performed at\r\nboth concerts was of my composition.\nHerr Maelzel thinks fit to say that he has delayed\r\nhis visit to London on account of the battle-piece,\r\nwhich is a mere subterfuge. He stayed to finish\r\nhis patchwork, as the first attempt did not succeed.\nBEETHOVEN.\nThe Summer of 1814.\nA thousand thanks, my esteemed Kauka. At\r\nlast I meet with a legal representative and a man,\r\nwho can both write and think without using unmeaning\r\nformulas. You can scarcely imagine how\r\nI long for the end of this affair, as it not only interferes\r\nwith my domestic expenditure, but is injurious\r\nto me in various ways. You know yourself that a\r\nsensitive spirit ought not to be fettered by miserable\r\nanxieties, and much that might render my life happy\r\nis thus abstracted from it. Even my inclination and\r\nthe duty I assigned myself, to serve suffering humanity\r\nby means of my art, I have been obliged to\r\nlimit, and must continue to do so.[1]\nI write nothing about our monarchs and monarchies,\r\nfor the newspapers give you every information\r\non these subjects.[2] The intellectual realm is\r\nthe most precious in my eyes, and far above all\r\ntemporal and spiritual monarchies. Write to me,\r\nhowever, what you wish for yourself from my poor\r\nmusical capabilities, that I may, in so far as it lies\r\nin my power, supply something for your own musical\r\nsense and feeling. Do you not require all the\r\npapers connected with the Kinsky case? If so I\r\nwill send them to you, as they contain most important\r\ntestimony, which, indeed, I believe you read\r\nwhen with me. Think of me and do not forget\r\nthat you represent a disinterested artist in opposition\r\nto a niggardly family. How gladly do men withhold\r\nfrom the poor artist in one respect what they\r\npay him in another, and there is no longer a Zeus\r\nwith whom an artist can invite himself to feast on\r\nambrosia. Strive, my dear friend, to accelerate the\r\ntardy steps of justice. Whenever I feel myself\r\nelevated high, and in happy moments revel in my\r\nartistic sphere, circumstances drag me down again,\r\nand none more than these two lawsuits. You too\r\nhave your disagreeable moments, though with the\r\nviews and capabilities I know you to possess,\r\nespecially in your profession, I could scarcely have\r\nbelieved this; still I must recall your attention to\r\nmyself. I have drunk to the dregs a cup of bitter\r\nsorrow, and already earned martyrdom in art\r\nthrough my beloved artistic disciples and colleagues.\r\nI beg you will think of me every day, and imagine\r\nit to be an entire world, for it is really asking rather\r\ntoo much of you to think of so humble an individual\r\nas myself.\nI am, with the highest esteem and friendship,\nYour obedient\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, July 25, 1814.\nHerr Maelzel, now in London, on his way\r\nthither performed my "Battle Symphony" and\r\n"Wellington\'s Battle of Vittoria" in Munich, and\r\nno doubt he intends to produce them at London\r\nconcerts, as he wished to do in Frankfort. This\r\ninduces me to declare that I never in any way made\r\nover or transferred the said works to Herr Maelzel;\r\nthat no one possesses a copy of them, and that the\r\nonly one verified by me I sent to his Royal Highness\r\nthe Prince Regent of England. The performance\r\nof these works, therefore, by Herr Maelzel is\r\neither an imposition on the public, as the above\r\ndeclaration proves that he does not possess them, or\r\nif he does, he has been guilty of a breach of faith\r\ntowards me, inasmuch as he must have got them in\r\na surreptitious manner.\nBut even in the latter case the public will still be\r\ndeluded, for the works that Herr Maelzel performs\r\nunder the titles of "Wellington\'s Battle of Vittoria"\r\nand "Battle Symphony" are beyond all doubt spurious\r\nand mutilated, as he never had any portion\r\nof either of these works of mine, except some of the\r\nparts for a few days.\nThis suspicion becomes a certainty from the testimony\r\nof various artists here, whose names I am\r\nauthorized to give if necessary. These gentlemen\r\nstate that Herr Maelzel, before he left Vienna,\r\ndeclared that he was in possession of these works,\r\nand showed various portions, which, however, as I\r\nhave already proved, must be counterfeit. The\r\nquestion whether Herr Maelzel be capable of doing\r\nme such an injury is best solved by the following\r\nfact,--In the public papers he named himself as sole\r\ngiver of the concert on behalf of our wounded\r\nsoldiers, whereas my works alone were performed\r\nthere, and yet he made no allusion whatsoever to\r\nme.\nI therefore appeal to the London musicians not\r\nto permit such a grievous wrong to be done to their\r\nfellow-artist by Herr Maelzel\'s performance of the\r\n"Battle of Vittoria" and the "Battle Symphony,"\r\nand also to prevent the London public being so\r\nshamefully imposed upon.\nVienna, August 22, 1814\nYou have shown a feeling for harmony, and you\r\ncan resolve a great discord in my life, which causes\r\nme much discomfort, into more pleasing melody, if\r\nyou will. I shortly expect to hear something of\r\nwhat you understand is likely to happen, as I eagerly\r\nanticipate the result of this most unjust affair\r\nwith the Kinskys. When the Princess was here,\r\nshe seemed to be well disposed towards me; still I\r\ndo not know how it will end. In the mean time I\r\nmust restrict myself in everything, and await with\r\nentire confidence what is rightfully my own and legally\r\ndevolves on me; and though unforeseen occurrences\r\ncaused changes in this matter, still two witnesses\r\nrecently bore testimony to the wish of the\r\ndeceased Prince that my appointed salary in Banco\r\nZettel should be paid in Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein, making\r\nup the original sum, and the Prince himself gave\r\nme sixty gold ducats on account of my claim.\nShould the affair turn out badly for me by the\r\nconduct of the Kinsky family, I will publish it in\r\nevery newspaper, to their disgrace. If there had\r\nbeen an heir, and the facts had been told to him in\r\nall their truth, just as I narrated them, I am convinced\r\nthat he would at once have adopted the\r\nwords and deeds of his predecessor. Has Dr. Wolf\r\n[the previous advocate] shown you the papers, or\r\nshall I make you acquainted with them? As I am\r\nby no means sure that this letter will reach you\r\nsafely, I defer sending you the pianoforte arrangement\r\nof my opera "Fidelio," which is ready to be\r\ndispatched.\nI hope, in accordance with your usual friendliness,\r\nsoon to hear from you. I am also writing to\r\nDr. Wolf (who certainly does not treat any one\r\nwolfishly), in order not to arouse his passion, so that\r\nhe may have compassion on me, and neither take\r\nmy purse nor my life.\nI am, with esteem, your true friend,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nBaden, Sept. 21, 1841.[1]\nMOST ESTEEMED COUNT AND FRIEND,--\nI unluckily only got your letter yesterday. A\r\nthousand thanks for your remembrance of me.\r\nPray express my gratitude also to your charming\r\nPrincess Christiane [wife of Prince Carl Lichnowsky].\r\nI had a delightful walk yesterday with\r\na friend in the Br\xc3\xbchl, and in the course of our\r\nfriendly chat you were particularly mentioned, and\r\nlo! and behold! on my return I found your kind\r\nletter. I see you are resolved to continue to load\r\nme with benefits.\nAs I am unwilling you should suppose that a\r\nstep I have already taken is prompted by your recent\r\nfavors, or by any motive of the sort, I must\r\ntell you that a sonata of mine [Op. 90] is about to\r\nappear, dedicated to you. I wished to give you a\r\nsurprise, as this dedication has been long designed\r\nfor you, but your letter of yesterday induces me to\r\nname the fact. I required no new motive thus\r\npublicly to testify my sense of your friendship and\r\nkindness. But as for anything approaching to a\r\ngift in return, you would only distress me, by thus\r\ntotally misinterpreting my intentions, and I should\r\nat once decidedly refuse such a thing.\nI beg to kiss the hand of the Princess for her\r\nkind message and all her goodness to me. Never\r\nhave I forgotten what I owe to you all, though an\r\nunfortunate combination of circumstances prevented\r\nmy testifying this as I could have wished.\nFrom what you tell me about Lord Castlereagh, I\r\nthink the matter in the best possible train. If I\r\nwere to give an opinion on the subject, I should\r\nsay that Lord Castlereagh ought to hear the work\r\ngiven here before writing to Wellington. I shall\r\nsoon be in Vienna, when we can consult together\r\nabout a grand concert. Nothing is to be effected\r\nat Court; I made the application, but--but--\n\n\n\nSilentium!!!\nFarewell, my esteemed friend; pray continue to\r\nesteem me worthy of your friendship. Yours,\nBEETHOVEN.\nA thousand compliments to the illustrious Princess.\n1814.\nI perceive that Y.R.H. wishes to try the effect\r\nof my music even upon horses.[1] We shall see\r\nwhether its influence will cause the riders to throw\r\nsome clever summersets. Ha! ha! I can\'t help\r\nlaughing at Y.R.H. thinking of me on such an\r\noccasion; for which I shall remain so long as I live,\r\n&c., &c., &c. The horse-music that Y.R.H. desires\r\nshall set off to you full gallop.\n[K.]\n1814.\nIt is impossible for me to-day to wait on you,\r\nmuch as I wish it. I am dispatching the work on\r\nWellington\'s victory[1] to London. Such matters\r\nhave their appointed and fixed time, which cannot\r\nbe delayed without final loss. To-morrow I hope\r\nto be able to call on Y.R.H.\n[K.]\n(In a different hand) Dec. 1814.\nI really feel that I can never deserve your\r\ngoodness towards me. I beg to offer my most respectful\r\nthanks for Y.R.H.\'s gracious intervention\r\nin my affairs at Prague. I will punctually attend\r\nto the score of the Cantata.[1] I trust Y.R.H. will\r\nforgive my not having yet been to see you. After\r\nthe concert for the poor, comes one in the theatre,\r\nequally for the benefit of the impresario in angustia,\r\nfor they have felt some just shame, and have let\r\nme off with one third and one half of the usual\r\ncharges. I have now some fresh work on hand,\r\nand then there is a new opera to be begun,[2] the\r\nsubject of which I am about to decide on. Moreover,\r\nI am again far from well, but a few days\r\nhence I will wait on Y.R.H. If I could be of\r\nany service to Y.R.H., the most eager and anxious\r\nwish of my life would be fulfilled.\n[K.]\n1814.\nMy warmest thanks for your present.[1] I only\r\nregret that you could not participate in the music.\r\nI have now the honor to send you the score of the\r\nCantata [see No. 134]. Y.R.H. can keep it for\r\nsome days, and afterwards I shall take care that it\r\nis copied for you as soon as possible.\nI feel still quite exhausted from fatigue and\r\nworry, pleasure and delight!--all combined! I\r\nshall have the honor of waiting on you in the course\r\nof a few days. I hope to hear favorable accounts\r\nof Y.R.H.\'s health. How gladly would I sacrifice\r\nmany nights, were it in my power to restore\r\nyou entirely!\n[K.]\n1814.[1]\nI see with real pleasure that I may dismiss all\r\nfears for your well-being. As for myself, I hope\r\n(always feeling happy when able to give you any\r\npleasure) that my health is also rapidly recruiting,\r\nwhen I intend forthwith to compensate both you\r\nand myself for the pauses that have occurred. As\r\nfor Prince Lobkowitz, his pauses with me still continue,\r\nand I fear he will never again come in at\r\nthe right place; and in Prague (good heavens!\r\nwith regard to Prince Kinsky\'s affair) they scarcely\r\nas yet know what a figured bass is, for they sing in\r\nslow, long-drawn choral notes; some of these sustained\r\nthrough sixteen bars |======|. As all these\r\ndiscords seem likely to be very slowly resolved, it\r\nis best to bring forward only those which we can\r\nourselves resolve, and to give up the rest to inevitable\r\nfate. Allow me once more to express my delight\r\nat the recovery of Y.R.H.\n[K.]\n1814.\nAs you were so kind as to let me know through\r\nCount Troyer[1] that you would write a few lines on\r\nmy affairs in Prague to the Oberstburggraf Count\r\nKolowrat, I take the liberty to enclose my letter to\r\nCount K.; I do not believe that it contains anything\r\nto which Y.R.H. will take exception. There\r\nis no chance of my being allowed payment in Einl\xc3\xb6sung\r\nSchein, for, in spite of all the proofs, the\r\nguardians cannot be persuaded to consent to this;\r\nstill it is to be hoped that by the friendly steps we\r\nhave meanwhile had recourse to, extra-judicially, a\r\nmore favorable result may be obtained,--as, for\r\ninstance, the rate of the scale to be higher. If,\r\nhowever, Y.R.H. will either write a few words\r\nyourself, or cause it to be done in your name, the\r\naffair will certainly be much accelerated, which induces\r\nme earnestly to entreat Y.R.H. to perform\r\nyour gracious promise to me. This affair has now\r\ngone on for three years, and is still--undecided.\n[K.]\n1814.\nI have again for a fortnight past been afflicted\r\nwith severe headaches, though constantly hoping to\r\nget better, but in vain. Now, however, that the\r\nweather is improved, my physician promises me a\r\nspeedy cure. Though as each day I expected to be\r\nthe last of my suffering, I did not write to you on\r\nthe subject; besides, I thought that Y.R.H. probably\r\ndid not require me, as it is so long since Y.R.H.\r\nsent for me. During the festivities in honor of\r\nthe Princess of Baden,[1] and the injury to Y.R.H.\'s\r\nfinger, I began to work very assiduously, and as\r\nthe fruit of this, among others, is a new pianoforte\r\ntrio.[2] Myself very much occupied, I had no idea\r\nthat I had incurred the displeasure of Y.R.H.,\r\nthough I now begin almost to think this to be the\r\ncase. In the mean time I hope soon to be able to\r\npresent myself before your tribunal.\n[K.]\n1814.\nI beg you will be so good as to let me have the\r\nTrio in B flat with all the parts, and also both parts\r\nof the violin Sonata in G,[1] as I must have them\r\nwritten out for myself with all speed, not being able\r\nto hunt out my own scores among so many others.\r\nI hope that this detestable weather has had no bad\r\neffect on Y.R.H.\'s health; I must own that it\r\nrather deranges me. In three or four days at least\r\nI shall have the honor to restore both works to\r\ntheir proper place.\nDo the musical pauses still continue?\n[K.]\nVienna, Jan. 11, 1815.\nMY GOOD, WORTHY K.,--\nI received Baron Pasqualati\'s letter to-day, by\r\nwhich I perceive that you wish me to defer any\r\nfresh measures. In the mean time all the necessary\r\npapers are lodged with Pasqualati; so be so good as\r\nto inform him that he must delay taking any further\r\nsteps. To-morrow a council is to be held here, and\r\nyou and P. shall learn the result probably to-morrow\r\nevening. Meanwhile I wish you to look through\r\nthe paper I sent to the Court through Pasqualati,\r\nand read the appendix carefully. You will then\r\nsee that Wolf and others have not given you correct\r\ninformation.\nOne thing is certain, that there are sufficient\r\nproofs for any one who wishes to be convinced. How\r\ncould it ever occur to me to think of written legal\r\ntestimony with such a man as Kinsky, whose integrity\r\nand generosity were everywhere acknowledged?\r\nI remain, with the warmest affection and esteem,\nIn haste, your friend,\r\nB.\n1815.\nMY DEAR AND ESTEEMED K.,--\nWhat can I think, or say, or feel? As for W.\r\n[Wolf], it seems to me that he not only showed his\r\nweak points, but gave himself no trouble to conceal\r\nthem. It is impossible that he can have drawn up\r\nhis statement in accordance with all the actual evidence\r\nhe had. The order on the treasury about\r\nthe rate of exchange was given by Kinsky previous\r\nto his consent to pay me my salary in Einl\xc3\xb6sung\r\nSchein, as the documents prove; indeed it is only\r\nnecessary to examine the date to show this, so the\r\nfirst instruction is of importance. The species facti\r\nprove that I was more than six months absent from\r\nVienna. As I was not anxious to get the money,\r\nI allowed the affair to stand over; so the Prince\r\nthus forgot to recall his former order to the treasury,\r\nbut that he neither forgot his promise to me,\r\nnor to Varnhagen [an officer] in my behalf, is\r\nevident by the testimony of Herr von Oliva, to\r\nwhom shortly before his departure from hence--and\r\nindeed into another world--he repeated his\r\npromise, making an appointment to see him when\r\nhe should return to Vienna, in order to arrange the\r\nmatter with the treasury, which of course was\r\nprevented by his untimely death.\nThe testimony of the officer Varnhagen is accompanied\r\nby a document (he being at present with\r\nthe Russian army), in which he states that he is\r\nprepared to take his oath on the affair. The evidence\r\nof Herr Oliva is also to the effect that he is\r\nwilling to confirm his evidence by oath before the\r\nCourt. As I have sent away the testimony of Col.\r\nCount Bentheim, I am not sure of its tenor, but I\r\nbelieve the Count also says that he is prepared at\r\nany time to make an affidavit on the matter in\r\nCourt, and I am myself ready to swear before the\r\nCourt that Prince Kinsky said to me in Prague,\r\n"he thought it only fair to me that my salary\r\nshould be paid in Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein." These were\r\nhis own words.\nHe gave me himself sixty gold ducats in Prague,\r\non account (good for about 600 florins), as, owing\r\nto my state of health, I could remain no longer, and\r\nset off for T\xc3\xb6plitz. The Prince\'s word was sacred\r\nin my eyes, never having heard anything of him\r\nto induce me either to bring two witnesses with me\r\nor to ask him for any written pledge. I see from\r\nall this that Dr. Wolf has miserably mismanaged\r\nthe business, and has not made you sufficiently acquainted\r\nwith the papers.\nNow as to the step I have just taken. The Archduke\r\nRudolph asked me some time since whether\r\nthe Kinsky affair was yet terminated, having probably\r\nheard something of it. I told him that it\r\nlooked very bad, as I knew nothing, absolutely\r\nnothing, of the matter. He offered to write himself,\r\nbut desired me to add a memorandum, and\r\nalso to make him acquainted with all the papers\r\nconnected with the Kinsky case. After having\r\ninformed himself on the affair, he wrote to the\r\nOberstburggraf, and enclosed my letter to him.\nThe Oberstburggraf answered both the Duke and\r\nmyself immediately. In the letter to me he said\r\n"that I was to present a petition to the Provincial\r\nCourt of Justice in Prague, along with all the proofs,\r\nwhence it would be forwarded to him, and that he\r\nwould do his utmost to further my cause." He also\r\nwrote in the most polite terms to the Archduke;\r\nindeed, he expressly said "that he was thoroughly\r\ncognizant of the late Prince Kinsky\'s intentions\r\nwith regard to me and this affair, and that I might\r\npresent a petition," &c. The Archduke instantly\r\nsent for me, and desired me to prepare the document\r\nand to show it to him; he also thought that\r\nI ought to solicit payment in Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein, as\r\nthere was ample proof, if not in strictly legal form,\r\nof the intentions of the Prince, and no one could\r\ndoubt that if he had survived he would have adhered\r\nto his promise. If he [the Archduke] were\r\nthis day the heir, he would demand no other proofs\r\nthan those already furnished. I sent this paper to\r\nBaron Pasqualati, who is kindly to present it himself\r\nto the Court. Not till after the affair had gone\r\nso far did Dr. Adlersburg receive a letter from Dr.\r\nWolf, in which he mentioned that he had made a\r\nclaim for 1500 florins. As we have come so far\r\nas 1500 florins with the Oberstburggraf, we may\r\npossibly get on to 1800 florins. I do not esteem\r\nthis any favor, for the late Prince was one of those\r\nwho urged me most to refuse a salary of 600 gold\r\nducats per annum, offered to me from Westphalia;\r\nand he said at the time "that he was resolved I\r\nshould have no chance of eating hams in Westphalia."\r\nAnother summons to Naples somewhat\r\nlater I equally declined, and I am entitled to demand\r\na fair compensation for the loss I incurred.\r\nIf the salary were to be paid in bank-notes, what\r\nshould I get? Not 400 florins in Conventionsgeld!!!\r\nin lieu of such a salary as 600 ducats! There\r\nare ample proofs for those who wish to act justly;\r\nand what does the Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein now amount\r\nto??!!! It is even at this moment no equivalent\r\nfor what I refused. This affair was pompously\r\nannounced in all the newspapers while I was nearly\r\nreduced to beggary. The intentions of the Prince\r\nare evident, and in my opinion the family are bound\r\nto act in accordance with them unless they wish to\r\nbe disgraced. Besides, the revenues have rather\r\nincreased than diminished by the death of the\r\nPrince; so there is no sufficient ground for curtailing\r\nmy salary.\nI received your friendly letter yesterday, but\r\nam too weary at this moment to write all that I\r\nfeel towards you. I can only commend my case to\r\nyour sagacity. It appears that the Oberstburggraf\r\nis the chief person; so what he wrote to the Archduke\r\nmust be kept a profound secret, for it might\r\nnot be advisable that any one should know of it but\r\nyou and Pasqualati. You have sufficient cause on\r\nlooking through the papers to show how improperly\r\nDr. Wolf has conducted the affair, and that another\r\ncourse of action is necessary. I rely on your\r\nfriendship to act as you think best for my interests.\nRest assured of my warmest thanks, and pray\r\nexcuse my writing more to-day, for a thing of this\r\nkind is very fatiguing,--more so than the greatest\r\nmusical undertaking. My heart has found something\r\nfor you to which yours will respond, and this\r\nyou shall soon receive.\nDo not forget me, poor tormented creature that\r\nI am! and act for me and effect for me all that is\r\npossible.\nWith high esteem, your true friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Jan. 14, 1815.\nMY GOOD AND WORTHY K.,--\nThe long letter I enclose was written when we\r\nwere disposed to claim the 1800 florins. Baron\r\nPasqualati\'s last letter, however, again made me\r\nwaver, and Dr. Adlersburg advised me to adhere\r\nto the steps already taken; but as Dr. Wolf writes\r\nthat he has offered in your name to accept 1500\r\nflorins a year, I beg you will at least make every\r\neffort to get that sum. For this purpose I send you\r\nthe long letter written before we received Baron\r\nP.\'s dissuasive one, as you may discover in it many\r\nreasons for demanding at least the 1500 florins.\r\nThe Archduke, too, has written a second time to\r\nthe Oberstburggraf, and we may conclude from his\r\nprevious reply that he will certainly exert himself,\r\nand that we shall at all events succeed in getting\r\nthe 1500 florins.\nFarewell! I cannot write another syllable; such\r\nthings exhaust me. May your friendship accelerate\r\nthis affair!--if it ends badly, then I must leave\r\nVienna, because I could not possibly live on my\r\nincome, for here things have come to such a pass\r\nthat everything has risen to the highest price, and\r\nthat price must be paid. The last two concerts I\r\ngave cost me 1508 florins, and had it not been for\r\nthe Empress\'s munificent present I should scarcely\r\nhave derived any profit whatever.\nYour faithful friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, 1815.\nGENTLEMEN,--\nQuite ignorant of law proceedings, and believing\r\nthat all claims on an inheritance could not fail to be\r\nliquidated, I sent to my lawyer in Prague [Dr.\r\nKauka] the contract signed by the Archduke Rudolph,\r\nPrince Lobkowitz, and Prince von Kinsky,\r\nin which these illustrious personages agreed to settle\r\non me an annual allowance of 4000 florins. My\r\nconstant efforts to obtain a settlement of my claim,\r\nand also, as I am bound to admit, my reproaches to\r\nDr. Kauka for not conducting the affair properly\r\n(his application to the guardians having proved\r\nfruitless), no doubt prompted him to have recourse\r\nto law.\nNone but those who are fully aware of my esteem\r\nfor the deceased Prince can tell how repugnant\r\nit is to my feelings to appear as a complainant\r\nagainst my benefactor.\nUnder these circumstances I have recourse to a\r\nshorter path, in the conviction that the guardians\r\nof the Prince\'s estate will be disposed to mark their\r\nappreciation of art, and also their desire to fulfil\r\nthe engagements of the late Prince. According to\r\nthe terms of the contract in question, the Archduke\r\nRudolph, Prince Lobkowitz, and Prince v. Kinsky\r\ngranted me these 4000 florins until I should obtain\r\na situation of equal value; and further, if by misfortune\r\nor old age I was prevented exercising my\r\nart, these distinguished contracting parties secured\r\nthis pension to me for life, while I, in return,\r\npledged myself not to leave Vienna.\nThis promise was generous, and equally generous\r\nwas its fulfilment, for no difficulty ever occurred,\r\nand I was in the peaceful enjoyment of my pension\r\ntill the Imperial Finance Patent appeared. The\r\nconsequent alteration in the currency made no difference\r\nin the payments of the Archduke Rudolph, for\r\nI received his share in Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein, as I had\r\npreviously done in bank-notes, without any reference\r\nto the new scale. The late illustrious Prince v.\r\nKinsky also at once assured me that his share (1800\r\nflorins) should also be paid in Einl\xc3\xb6sung Schein. As\r\nhowever, he omitted giving the order to his cashier,\r\ndifficulties arose on the subject. Although my circumstances\r\nare not brilliant, I would not have ventured\r\nto bring this claim before the notice of the\r\nguardians of the estate, if respectable, upright men\r\nhad not received the same pledge from the late\r\nPrince\'s own lips, namely, that he would pay my\r\npast as well as my future claims in Vienna currency,\r\nwhich is proved by the papers B, C, D, appended\r\nto the pleas. Under these circumstances I leave\r\nthe guardians to judge whether, after so implicitly\r\nrelying on the promise of the deceased Prince, I\r\nhave not cause to complain of my delicacy being\r\nwounded by the objection advanced by the curators\r\nto the witnesses, from their not having been present\r\ntogether at the time the promise was made, which\r\nis most distressing to my feelings.\nIn order to extricate myself from this most disagreeable\r\nlawsuit, I take the liberty to give an\r\nassurance to the guardians that I am prepared, both\r\nas to the past and the future, to be satisfied with\r\nthe 1800 florins, Vienna currency; and I flatter\r\nmyself that these gentlemen will admit that I on\r\nmy part make thus no small sacrifice, as it was\r\nsolely from my esteem for those illustrious Princes\r\nthat I selected Vienna for my settled abode, at a\r\ntime when the most advantageous offers were\r\nmade to me elsewhere.\nI therefore request the Court to submit this proposal\r\nto the guardians of the Kinsky estates for their\r\nopinion, and to be so good as to inform me of the\r\nresult.\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nJanuary, 1815.\nMY ESTEEMED FRIEND,--\nI beg you will kindly send me by the bearer the\r\nproper form for the Kinsky receipt (but sealed) for\r\n600 florins half-yearly from the month of April. I\r\nintend to send the receipt forthwith to Dr. Kauka\r\nin Prague,[1] who on a former occasion procured the\r\nmoney for me so quickly. I will deduct your debt\r\nfrom this, but if it be possible to get the money here\r\nbefore the remittance arrives from Prague, I will\r\nbring it at once to you myself.\nI remain, with the most profound esteem,\nYour sincere friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN\nVienna, Feb. 24, 1815.\nMY MUCH ESTEEMED K.,--\nI have repeatedly thanked you through Baron\r\nPasqualati for your friendly exertions on my behalf,\r\nand I now beg to express one thousand thanks myself.\r\nThe intervention of the Archduke could not\r\nbe very palatable to you, and perhaps has prejudiced\r\nyou against me. You had already done all that\r\nwas possible when the Archduke interfered. If this\r\nhad been the case sooner, and we had not employed\r\nthat one-sided, or many-sided, or weak-sided Dr.\r\nWolf, then, according to the assurances of the\r\nOberstburggraf himself, the affair might have had a\r\nstill more favorable result. I shall therefore ever\r\nand always be grateful to you for your services.\r\nThe Court now deduct the sixty ducats I mentioned\r\nof my own accord, and to which the late Prince\r\nnever alluded either to his treasurer or any one else.\r\nWhere truth could injure me it has been accepted,\r\nso why reject it when it could have benefited me?\r\nHow unfair! Baron Pasqualati requires information\r\nfrom you on various points.\nI am again very tired to-day, having been obliged\r\nto discuss many things with poor P.; such matters\r\nexhaust me more than the greatest efforts in composition.\r\nIt is a new field, the soil of which I ought\r\nnot to be required to till. This painful business has\r\ncost me many tears and much sorrow. The time\r\ndraws near when Princess Kinsky must be written\r\nto. Now I must conclude. How rejoiced shall I\r\nbe when I can write you the pure effusions of my\r\nheart once more; and this I mean to do as soon as\r\nI am extricated from all these troubles. Pray\r\naccept again my heartfelt thanks for all that you\r\nhave done for me, and continue your regard for\nYour attached friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1815.\nI heard yesterday, and it was indeed confirmed\r\nby meeting Count Troyer, that Y.R.H. is now\r\nhere. I therefore send the dedication of the Trio\r\n[in B flat] to Y.R.H., whose name is inscribed on\r\nit; but all my works on which I place any value,\r\nthough the name does not appear, are equally designed\r\nfor Y.R.H. I trust, however, that you will\r\nnot think I have a motive in saying this,--men of\r\nhigh rank being apt to suspect self-interest in such\r\nexpressions,--and I mean on this occasion to risk the\r\nimputation so far as appearances go, by at once asking\r\na favor of Y.R.H. My well-grounded reasons\r\nfor so doing you will no doubt at once perceive, and\r\ngraciously vouchsafe to grant my request. I have\r\nbeen very much indisposed in Baden since the beginning\r\nof last October; indeed, from the 5th of\r\nOctober I have been entirely confined to my bed,\r\nor to my room, till about a week ago. I had a very\r\nserious inflammatory cold, and am still able to go\r\nout very little, which has also been the cause of my\r\nnot writing to Y.R.H. in Kremsir. May all the\r\nblessings that Heaven can shower upon earth attend\r\nyou.\n[K.]\nVienna, March 3, 1815.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever, dear Spohr, you chance to find true\r\nart and true artists, may you kindly remember\nYour friend,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, April 8, 1815.\nIt seems scarcely admissible to be on the friendly\r\nterms on which I consider myself with you, and yet\r\nto be on such unfriendly ones that we should live\r\nclose to each other and never meet!!!!![1] You\r\nwrite "tout \xc3\xa0 vous." Oh! you humbug! said I.\r\nNo! no! it is really too bad. I should like to thank\r\nyou 9000 times for all your efforts on my behalf,\r\nand to reproach you 20,000 that you came and\r\nwent as you did. So all is a delusion! friendship,\r\nkingdom, empire; all is only a vapor which\r\nevery breeze wafts into a different form!! Perhaps\r\nI may go to T\xc3\xb6plitz, but it is not certain. I might\r\ntake advantage of that opportunity to let the people\r\nof Prague hear something--what think you? if\r\nindeed you still think of me at all! As the affair\r\nwith Lobkowitz is now also come to a close, we may\r\nwrite Finis, though it far from fine is for me.\nBaron Pasqualati will no doubt soon call on you\r\nagain; he also has taken much trouble on my\r\naccount. Yes, indeed! it is easy to talk of justice,\r\nbut to obtain it from others is no easy matter. In\r\nwhat way can I be of service to you in my own\r\nart? Say whether you prefer my celebrating the\r\nmonologue of a fugitive king, or the perjury of a\r\nusurper--or the true friends, who, though near\r\nneighbors, never saw each other? In the hope of\r\nsoon hearing from you--for being now so far\r\nasunder it is easier to hold intercourse than when\r\nnearer!--I remain, with highest esteem,\nYour ever-devoted friend,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1815.\nMY DEAR AND WORTHY K.,--\nI have just received from the Syndic Baier in R.\r\nthe good news that you told him yourself about\r\nPrince F.K. As for the rest, you shall be perfectly\r\nsatisfied.\nI take the liberty to ask you again to look after\r\nmy interests with the Kinsky family, and I subjoin\r\nthe necessary receipt for this purpose [see No. 144].\r\nPerhaps some other way may be found, though it\r\ndoes not as yet occur to me, by means of which I\r\nneed not importune you in future. On the 15th October\r\n[1815] I was attacked by an inflammatory\r\ncold, from the consequences of which I still suffer,\r\nand my art likewise; but it is to be hoped that I shall\r\nnow gradually recover, and at all events be able\r\nonce more to display the riches of my little realm\r\nof sweet sounds. Yet I am very poor in all else--owing\r\nto the times? to poverty of spirit? or\r\nwhat???? Farewell! Everything around disposes\r\nus to profound silence; but this shall not be\r\nthe case as to the bond of friendship and soul that\r\nunites us. I loudly proclaim myself, now as ever,\nYour loving friend and admirer,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1815.\nMY MOST WORTHY FRIEND,--\nMy second letter follows that of yesterday, May\r\n2d. Pasqualati tells me to-day, after the lapse of\r\na month and six days, that the house of Ballabene\r\nis too high and mighty to assist me in this matter.\r\nI must therefore appeal to your insignificance (as I\r\nmyself do not hesitate to be so mean as to serve\r\nother people). My house-rent amounts to 550\r\nflorins, and must be paid out of the sum in question.\nAs soon as the newly engraved pianoforte pieces\r\nappear, you shall receive copies, and also of the\r\n"Battle," &c., &c. Forgive me, forgive me, my\r\ngenerous friend; some other means must be found\r\nto forward this affair with due promptitude.\nIn haste, your friend and admirer,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, June 1, 1815.\nMY GOOD FELLOW-COUNTRYMAN,--\nI always hoped to meet you one day in London,\r\nbut many obstacles have intervened to prevent the\r\nfulfilment of this wish, and as there seems now no\r\nchance of such a thing, I hope you will not refuse\r\na request of mine, which is that you will be so obliging\r\nas to apply to some London publisher, and offer\r\nhim the following works of mine. Grand Trio for\r\npiano, violin, and violoncello [Op. 97], 80 ducats.\r\nPianoforte Sonata, with violin accompaniment [Op.\r\n96], 60 ducats. Grand Symphony in A (one of\r\nmy very best); a short Symphony in F [the 8th];\r\nQuartet for two violins, viola, and violoncello in F\r\nminor [Op. 95]; Grand Opera in score, 30 ducats.\r\nCantata with Choruses and Solos ["The Glorious\r\nMoment"], 30 ducats. Score of the "Battle of\r\nVittoria" and "Wellington\'s Victory," 80 ducats;\r\nalso the pianoforte arrangement of the same, if not\r\nalready published, which, I am told here, is the case.\r\nI have named the prices of some of these works, on\r\na scale which I hold to be suitable for England, but\r\nI leave it to you to say what sum should be asked\r\nboth for these and the others. I hear, indeed, that\r\nCramer [John, whose pianoforte-playing was highly\r\nestimated by Beethoven] is also a publisher, but my\r\nscholar Ries lately wrote to me that Cramer not\r\nlong since publicly expressed his disapproval of my\r\nworks: I trust from no motive but that of being of\r\nservice to art, and if so I have no right to object to\r\nhis doing this. If, however, Cramer should wish to\r\npossess any of my pernicious works, I shall be as\r\nwell satisfied with him as with any other publisher;\r\nbut I reserve the right to give these works to be\r\npublished here, so that they may appear at the same\r\nmoment in London and Vienna.\nPerhaps you may also be able to point out to me\r\nin what way I can recover from the Prince Regent\r\n[afterwards George IV.] the expenses of transcribing\r\nthe "Battle Symphony" on Wellington\'s victory\r\nat Vittoria, to be dedicated to him, for I have\r\nlong ago given up all hope of receiving anything\r\nfrom that quarter. I have not even been deemed\r\nworthy of an answer, whether I am to be authorized\r\nto dedicate the work to the Prince Regent; and\r\nwhen at last I propose to publish it here, I am informed\r\nthat it has already appeared in London.\r\nWhat a fatality for an author!!! While the\r\nEnglish and German papers are filled with accounts\r\nof the success of the work, as performed at Drury\r\nLane, and that theatre drawing great receipts from\r\nit, the author has not one friendly line to show, not\r\neven payment for the cost of copying the work, and\r\nis thus deprived of all profit.[2] For if it be true that\r\nthe pianoforte arrangement is soon to be published\r\nby a German publisher, copied from the London\r\none, then I lose both my fame and my honorarium.\r\nThe well-known generosity of your character leads\r\nme to hope that you will take some interest in the\r\nmatter, and actively exert yourself on my behalf.\nThe inferior paper-money of this country is now\r\nreduced to one fifth of its value, and I am paid according\r\nto this scale. After many struggles and\r\nconsiderable loss, I at length succeeded in obtaining\r\nthe full value; but at this moment the old paper-money\r\nhas again risen far beyond the fifth part, so\r\nthat it is evident my salary becomes for the second\r\ntime almost nil, and there is no hope of any compensation.\r\nMy whole income is derived from my\r\nworks. If I could rely on a good sale in England,\r\nit would doubtless be very beneficial to me. Pray\r\nbe assured of my boundless gratitude. I hope soon,\r\nvery soon, to hear from you.\nI am, with esteem, your sincere friend,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1815.\nPray forgive my asking Y.R.H. to send me the\r\ntwo Sonatas with violin obbligato[1] which I caused\r\nto be transcribed for Y.R.H. I require them only\r\nfor a few days, when I will immediately return\r\nthem.\n[K.]\n1815.\nI beg you will kindly send me the Sonata in E\r\nminor,[1] as I wish to correct it. On Monday I shall\r\ninquire for Y.R.H. in person. Recent occurrences[2]\r\nrender it indispensable to complete many works of\r\nmine about to be engraved as quickly as possible;\r\nbesides, my health is only partially restored. I earnestly\r\nentreat Y.R.H. to desire some one to write\r\nme a few lines as to the state of your own health.\r\nI trust I shall hear a better--nay, the best report\r\nof it.\n[K.]\n1815.\nYou must almost think my illness a mere fiction,\r\nbut that is assuredly not the case. I am obliged\r\nalways to come home early in the evening. The\r\nfirst time that Y.R.H. was graciously pleased to\r\nsend for me, I came home immediately afterwards,\r\nbut feeling much better since then, I made an attempt\r\nthe evening before last to stay out a little\r\nlater. If Y.R.H. does not countermand me, I intend\r\nto have the honor of waiting on you this evening\r\nat five o\'clock. I will bring the new Sonata\r\nwith me, merely for to-day, for it is so soon to be\r\nengraved that it is not worth while to have it written\r\nout.\n[K.]\n1815.\nI intended to have given you this letter myself,\r\nbut my personal attendance might possibly be an\r\nintrusion; so I take the liberty once more to urge\r\non Y.R.H. the request it contains. I should also\r\nbe glad if Y.R.H. would send me back my last\r\nMS. Sonata, for as I must publish it, it would be\r\nlabor lost to have it transcribed, and I shall soon\r\nhave the pleasure of presenting it to you engraved.\r\nI will call again in a few days. I trust these joyous\r\ntimes may have a happy influence on your precious\r\nhealth.\n[K.]\nVienna, July 23, 1815.\nWhen you were recently in town, the enclosed\r\nChorus[1] occurred to me. I hurried home to write\r\nit down, but was detained longer in doing so than\r\nI at first expected, and thus, to my great sorrow, I\r\nmissed Y.R.H. The bad custom I have followed\r\nfrom childhood, instantly to write down my first\r\nthoughts, otherwise they not unfrequently go astray,\r\nhas been an injury to me on this occasion. I therefore\r\nsend Y.R.H. my impeachment and my justification,\r\nand trust I may find grace in your eyes.\r\nI hope soon to present myself before Y.R.H.,\r\nand to inquire after a health so precious to us all.\n[K.]\n1815.\nIt is neither presumption, nor the pretension of\r\nadvocating any one\'s cause, still less from the wish\r\nof arrogating to myself the enjoyment of any especial\r\nfavor with Y.R.H., that induces me to make\r\na suggestion which is in itself very simple. Old\r\nKraft[1] was with me yesterday; he wished to know\r\nif it were possible for him to be lodged in your palace,\r\nin return for which he would be at Y.R.H.\'s\r\nservice as often as you please it. He has lived for\r\ntwenty years in the house of Prince Lobkowitz, and\r\nduring a great part of that time he received no salary;\r\nhe is now obliged to vacate his rooms without\r\nreceiving any compensation whatever. The position\r\nof the poor deserving old man is hard, and I\r\nshould have considered myself equally hard, had I\r\nnot ventured to lay his case before you. Count\r\nTroyer will request an answer from Y.R.H. As\r\nthe object in view is to brighten the lot of a fellow-creature,\r\npray forgive your, &c., &c.\n[K.]\nMr. Beethoven send word to Mr. Birchall that\r\nit is severall days past that he has sent for London\r\nWellington\'s Battel Sinphonie and that Mr.\r\nB[irchall] may send for it at Thomas Coutts. Mr.\r\nBeethoven wish Mr. B. would make ingrave the\r\nsayd Sinphonie so soon as possible and send him\r\nword in time the day it will be published that he\r\nmay prevend in time the Publisher in Vienna.\nIn regard the 3. Sonata which Mr. Birchall receive\r\nafterwerths there is not wanted such a g\'t\r\nhurry and Mr. B. will take the liberty to fixe the\r\nday when the are to be published.\nMr. B[irchall] sayd that Mr. Salomon has a\r\ngood many tings to say concerning the Synphonie\r\nin G [? A].\nMr. B[eethoven] wish for a answer so soon as\r\npossible concerning the days of the publication.\nOctober 16, 1815.\nI only wish to let you know that I am here, and\r\nnot elsewhere, and wish in return to hear if you are\r\nelsewhere or here. I should be glad to speak to you\r\nfor a few minutes when I know that you are at\r\nhome and alone. Farewell--but not too well--sublime\r\nCommandant Pacha of various mouldering\r\nfortresses!!!\nIn haste, your friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nNov. 16, 1815.\nSince yesterday afternoon I have been lying in\r\na state of exhaustion, owing to my great distress of\r\nmind caused by the sudden death of my unhappy\r\nbrother. It was impossible for me to send an answer\r\nto Y.R.H. yesterday, and I trust you will\r\ngraciously receive my present explanation. I expect,\r\nhowever, certainly to wait on Y.R.H. to-morrow.\n[K.]\nVienna, Nov. 22, 1815.\nYou will herewith receive the pianoforte arrangement\r\nof the Symphony in A. "Wellington\'s\r\nBattle Symphony," and "Victory at Vittoria"\r\nwere sent a month since, through Herr Neumann,\r\nto the care of Messrs. Coutts; so you have no doubt\r\nreceived them long ere this.\nIn the course of a fortnight you shall have the\r\nTrio and Sonata, when you are requested to pay\r\ninto the hands of Messrs. Coutts the sum of 130\r\ngold ducats. I beg you will make no delay in\r\nbringing out these works, and likewise let me know\r\non what day the "Wellington Symphony" is to\r\nappear, so that I may take my measures here accordingly.\r\nI am, with esteem,\nYour obedient\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Wednesday, Nov. 22, 1815.\nMY DEAR RIES,--\nI hasten to apprise you that I have to-day forwarded\r\nby post the pianoforte arrangement of the\r\nSymphony in A, to the care of Messrs Coutts. As\r\nthe Court is absent, few, indeed almost no couriers\r\ngo from here; moreover, the post is the safest way.\r\nThe Symphony ought to be brought out about\r\nMarch; the precise day I will fix myself. So\r\nmuch time has already been lost on this occasion\r\nthat I could not give an earlier notice of the period\r\nof publication. The Trio in [??] and the violin\r\nSonata may be allowed more time, and both will be\r\nin London a few weeks hence. I earnestly entreat\r\nyou, dear Ries, to take charge of these matters, and\r\nalso to see that I get the money; I require it, and\r\nit costs me a good deal before all is sent off.\nI have lost 600 florins of my yearly salary; at\r\nthe time of the bank-notes there was no loss, but\r\nthen came the Einl\xc3\xb6sungsscheine [reduced paper-money],\r\nwhich deprives me of these 600 florins,\r\nafter entailing on me several years of annoyance,\r\nand now the total loss of my salary. We are at\r\npresent arrived at a point when the Einl\xc3\xb6sungsscheine\r\nare even lower than the bank-notes ever were.\r\nI pay 1000 florins for house-rent: you may thus\r\nconceive all the misery caused by paper-money.\nMy poor unhappy brother [Carl v. Beethoven, a\r\ncashier in Vienna] is just dead [Nov. 15th, 1815];\r\nhe had a bad wife. For some years past he has\r\nbeen suffering from consumption, and from my wish\r\nto make his life less irksome I may compute what\r\nI gave him at 10,000 florins (Wiener W\xc3\xa4hrung).\r\nThis indeed does not seem much to an Englishman,\r\nbut it is a great deal for a poor German, or rather\r\nAustrian. The unhappy man was latterly much\r\nchanged, and I must say I lament him from my\r\nheart, though I rejoice to think I left nothing undone\r\nthat could contribute to his comfort.\nTell Mr. Birchall that he is to repay the postage\r\nof my letters to you and Mr. Salomon, and also\r\nyours to me; he may deduct this from the sum he\r\nowes me; I am anxious that those who work for\r\nme should lose as little as possible by it. "Wellington\'s\r\nVictory at Vittoria"[1] must have arrived\r\nlong ago through the Messrs. Coutts. Mr. Birchall\r\nneed not send payment till he is in possession\r\nof all the works; only do not delay letting me know\r\nwhen the day is fixed for the publication of the\r\npianoforte arrangement. For to-day, I only further\r\nearnestly recommend my affairs to your care; I\r\nshall be equally at your service at any time. Farewell,\r\ndear Ries.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nJan. 1816.\nMY GOOD ZMESKALL,--\nI was shocked to discover to-day that I had\r\nomitted replying to a proposal from the "Society\r\nof Friends to Music in the Austrian States" to\r\nwrite an Oratorio for them.\nThe death of my brother two months ago, which,\r\nowing to the guardianship of my nephew having\r\ndevolved on me, has involved me in all sorts of annoyances\r\nand perplexities, has caused this delay in\r\nmy answer. In the mean time, the poem of Herr\r\nvan Seyfried is already begun, and I purpose\r\nshortly to set it to music. I need not tell you how\r\nvery flattering I consider such a commission, for\r\nhow could I think otherwise? and I shall endeavor\r\nto acquit myself as honorably as my poor talents\r\nwill admit of.\nWith regard to our artistic resources, when the\r\ntime for the performance arrives I shall certainly\r\ntake into consideration those usually at our disposal,\r\nwithout, however, strictly limiting myself to them.\r\nI hope I have made myself clearly understood on\r\nthis point. As I am urged to say what gratuity I\r\nrequire in return, I beg to know whether the Society\r\nwill consider 400 gold ducats a proper remuneration\r\nfor such a work? I once more entreat\r\nthe forgiveness of the Society for the delay in my\r\nanswer, but I am in some degree relieved by knowing\r\nthat, at all events, you, my dear friend, have\r\nalready verbally apprised the Society of my readiness\r\nto write a work of the kind.[1]\nEver, my worthy Z., your\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Jan. 6, 1816.\nMY HIGHLY VALUED MDLLE. MILDER, MY DEAR FRIEND,--\nI have too long delayed writing to you. How\r\ngladly would I personally participate in the enthusiasm\r\nyou excite at Berlin in "Fidelio!" A thousand\r\nthanks on my part for having so faithfully adhered\r\nto my "Fidelio." If you will ask Baron de\r\nla Motte-Fouqu\xc3\xa9, in my name, to discover a good\r\nsubject for an opera, and one suitable likewise to\r\nyourself, you will do a real service both to me and\r\nto the German stage; it is also my wish to write it\r\nexpressly for the Berlin Theatre, as no new opera\r\ncan ever succeed in being properly given here under\r\nthis very penurious direction. Answer me\r\nsoon, very soon--quickly, very quickly--as\r\nquickly as possible--as quick as lightning--and\r\nsay whether such a thing is practicable. Herr\r\nKapellmeister B. praised you up to the skies to me,\r\nand he is right; well may he esteem himself happy\r\nwho has the privilege of enjoying your muse, your\r\ngenius, and all your splendid endowments and talents;--it\r\nis thus I feel. Be this as it may, those\r\naround can only call themselves your fellow-creatures\r\n[Nebenmann], whereas I alone have a right\r\nto claim the honored name of captain [Hauptmann].\nIn my secret heart, your true friend and admirer,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nMy poor unfortunate brother is dead, which has\r\nbeen the cause of my long silence. As soon as you\r\nhave replied to this letter, I will write myself to\r\nBaron de la Motte-Fouqu\xc3\xa9. No doubt your influence\r\nin Berlin will easily obtain for me a commission\r\nto write a grand opera (in which you shall be especially\r\nstudied) on favorable terms; but do answer\r\nme soon, that I may arrange my other occupations\r\naccordingly.\n\n\n\nAway with all other false Hauptm\xc3\xa4nner! [captains.]\nVienna, Jan. 20, 1816.\nDEAR RIES,--\nThe Symphony is to be dedicated to the Empress\r\nof Russia. The pianoforte score of the Symphony\r\nin A must not, however, appear before June, for\r\nthe publisher here cannot be ready sooner. Pray,\r\ndear Ries, inform Mr. Birchall of this at once.\r\nThe Sonata with violin accompaniment, which will\r\nbe sent from here by the next post, can likewise\r\nbe published in London in May, but the Trio at a\r\nlater date (it follows by the next post); I will myself\r\nname the time for its publication. And now,\r\ndear Ries, pray receive my heartfelt thanks for\r\nyour kindness, and especially for the corrections of\r\nthe proofs. May Heaven bless you more and more,\r\nand promote your progress, in which I take the\r\nmost sincere interest. My kind regards to your\r\nwife. Now as ever,\nYour sincere friend,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nVienne, le 3. Febr. den 1816\nVOUS RECEUES CI JOINT--\nLe grand Trio p. Pf. V. et Vllo. Sonata pour\r\nPf. et Violin--qui form le reste de ce qu\'il vous a\r\nplus \xc3\xa0 me comettre. Je vous prie de vouloir payer\r\nla some de 130 Ducats d\'Holland come le poste\r\nlettre a Mr. Th. Cutts et Co. de votre ville e de\r\nme croire avec toute l\'estime et consideration\nVotre tres humble Serviteur,\r\nLOUIS VAN BEETHOVEN.\nMY DEAR CZERNY,--\nPray give the enclosed to your parents for the\r\ndinners the boy had recently at your house; I positively\r\nwill not accept these gratis. Moreover, I\r\nam very far from wishing that your lessons should\r\nremain without remuneration,--even those already\r\ngiven must be reckoned up and paid for; only I\r\nbeg you to have a little patience for a time, as nothing\r\ncan be demanded from the widow, and I had\r\nand still have heavy expenses to defray;--but I\r\nborrow from you for the moment only. The boy is\r\nto be with you to-day, and I shall come later.\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Feb. 12, 1816.\nDEAR CZERNY,--\nI cannot see you to-day, but I will call to-morrow\r\nbeing desirous to talk to you. I spoke out so\r\nbluntly yesterday that I much regretted it afterwards.\r\nBut you must forgive this on the part of\r\nan author, who would have preferred hearing his\r\nwork as he wrote it, however charmingly you\r\nplayed it. I will, however, amply atone for this by\r\nthe violoncello Sonata.[2]\nRest assured that I cherish the greatest regard\r\nfor you as an artist, and I shall always endeavor to\r\nprove this.\nYour true friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, Feb. 28, 1816.\n... For some time past I have been far from\r\nwell; the loss of my brother affected both my spirits\r\nand my works. Salomon\'s death grieves me much,\r\nas he was an excellent man whom I have known\r\nfrom my childhood. You are his executor by will,\r\nwhile I am the guardian of my late poor brother\'s\r\nchild. You can scarcely have had as much vexation\r\nfrom Salomon\'s death as I have had from that\r\nof my brother!--but I have the sweet consolation\r\nof having rescued a poor innocent child from the\r\nhands of an unworthy mother. Farewell, dear\r\nRies; if I can in any way serve you, look on me as\nYour true friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nFeb. 1816.\nSIR,--\nI have great pleasure in saying that at last I intend\r\nto-morrow to place under your care the dear\r\npledge intrusted to me. But I must impress on\r\nyou not to permit any influence on the mother\'s\r\npart to decide when and where she is to see her\r\nson. We can, however, discuss all this more minutely\r\nto-morrow.... You must keep a watchful\r\neye on your servant, for mine was bribed by her\r\non one occasion. More as to this verbally, though\r\nit is a subject on which I would fain be silent; but\r\nthe future welfare of the youth you are to train\r\nrenders this unpleasant communication necessary.\r\nI remain, with esteem,\nYour faithful servant and friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1816.\nYour estimable lady, Mdme. A.G. [Giannatasio]\r\nis politely requested to let the undersigned know\r\nas soon as possible (that I may not be obliged to\r\nkeep it all in my head) how many pairs of stockings,\r\ntrousers, shoes, and drawers are required, and\r\nhow many yards of kerseymere to make a pair of\r\nblack trousers for my tall nephew; and for the\r\nsake of the "Castalian Spring" I beg, without any\r\nfurther reminders on my part, that I may receive\r\nan answer to this.\nAs for the Lady Abbess [a nickname for their\r\nonly daughter], there shall be a conference held\r\non Carl\'s affair to-night, viz., if things are to continue\r\nas they are.\nYour well (and ill) born\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1816.\nI heard yesterday evening, unluckily at too late\r\nan hour, that you had something to give me; had\r\nit not been for this, I would have called on you. I\r\nbeg, however, that you will send it, as I have no\r\ndoubt it is a letter for me from the "Queen of the\r\nNight."[1] Although you gave me permission to\r\nfetch Carl twice already, I must ask you to let him\r\ncome to me when I send for him at eleven o\'clock\r\nto-morrow, as I wish to take him with me to hear\r\nsome interesting music. It is also my intention to\r\nmake him play to me to-morrow, as it is now some\r\ntime since I heard him. I hope you will urge him\r\nto study more closely than usual to-day, that he\r\nmay in some degree make up for his holiday. I\r\nembrace you cordially, and remain,\nYours truly,\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\n1816.\nI send you, dear sir, the cloak, and also a school-book\r\nof my Carl\'s, and request you will make out\r\na list of his clothes and effects, that I may have it\r\ncopied for myself, being obliged, as his guardian, to\r\nlook carefully after his property. I intend to call\r\nfor Carl to-morrow about half-past twelve o\'clock,\r\nto take him to a little concert, and wish him to dine\r\nwith me afterwards, and shall bring him back myself.\r\nWith respect to his mother, I desire that\r\nunder the pretext of the boy being so busy, you will\r\nnot let her see him; no man on earth can know or\r\njudge of this matter better than myself, and by any\r\nother line of conduct all my well-matured plans for\r\nthe welfare of the child might be materially injured.\r\nI will myself discuss with you when the mother is\r\nhenceforth to have access to Carl, for I am anxious\r\non every account to prevent the occurrence of yesterday\r\never being repeated. I take all the responsibility\r\non myself; indeed, so far as I am concerned,\r\nthe Court conferred on me full powers, and the\r\nauthority at once to counteract anything adverse to\r\nthe welfare of the boy. If they could have looked\r\non her in the light of an estimable mother, they\r\nassuredly would not have excluded her from the\r\nguardianship of her child. Whatever she may\r\nthink fit to assert, nothing has been done in a clandestine\r\nmanner against her. There was but one\r\nvoice in the whole council on the subject. I hope\r\nto have no further trouble in this matter, for the\r\nburden is already heavy enough.\nFrom a conversation I had yesterday with Adlersburg\r\n[his lawyer], it would appear that a long\r\ntime must yet elapse before the Court can decide\r\nwhat really belongs to the child. In addition to\r\nall these anxieties am I also to endure a persecution\r\nsuch as I have recently experienced, and from\r\nwhich I thought I was entirely rescued by your Institution?\r\nFarewell!\nI am, with esteem, your obedient\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, March 8, 1816.\nMy answer has been too long delayed; but I\r\nwas ill, and had a great press of business. Not a\r\nsingle farthing is yet come of the ten gold ducats,\r\nand I now almost begin to think that the English\r\nare only liberal when in foreign countries. It is\r\nthe same with the Prince Regent, who has not\r\neven sent me the cost of copying my "Battle Symphony,"\r\nnor one verbal or written expression of\r\nthanks. My whole income consists of 3400 florins\r\nin paper-money. I pay 1100 for house-rent, and\r\n900 to my servant and his wife; so you may reckon\r\nfor yourself what remains. Besides this, the entire\r\nmaintenance of my young nephew devolves on\r\nme. At present he is at school, which costs 1100\r\nflorins, and is by no means a good one; so that I\r\nmust arrange a proper household and have him\r\nwith me. How much money must be made to live\r\nat all here! and yet there seems no end to\r\nit--because!--because!--because!--but you know\r\nwell what I mean.\nSome commissions from the Philharmonic would\r\nbe very acceptable to me, besides, the concert.\r\nNow let me say that my dear scholar Ries must set\r\nto work and dedicate something valuable to me, to\r\nwhich his master may respond, and repay him in\r\nhis own coin. How can I send you my portrait?\r\nMy kind regards to your wife. I, alas! have none.\r\nOne alone I wished to possess, but never shall I\r\ncall her mine![1] This, however, has not made me\r\na woman-hater.\nYour true friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, April 3, 1816.\nNeate[1] is no doubt in London by this time.\r\nHe took several of my works with him, and promised\r\nto do the best he could for me.\nThe Archduke Rudolph [Beethoven\'s pupil,\r\nsee No. 70] also plays your works with me, my\r\ndear Ries; of these "Il Sogno" especially pleased\r\nus. Farewell! Remember me to your charming\r\nwife, and to any fair English ladies who care to\r\nreceive my greetings.\nYour true friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, May 2, 1816.\nI authorize Herr v. Kauka, Doctor of Laws in\r\nthe kingdom of Bohemia, relying on his friendship,\r\nto obtain for me the receipt of 600 florins W.W.,\r\npayable at the treasury of Prince Kinsky, from the\r\nhouse of Ballabene in Prague, and after having\r\ndrawn the money to transmit the same to me as\r\nsoon as possible.\nWitness my hand and seal.\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, June 11, 1816.\nMY DEAR RIES,--\nI regret much to put you to the expense of postage\r\non my account; gladly as I assist and serve\r\nevery one, I am always unwilling myself to have\r\nrecourse to others. I have as yet seen nothing of\r\nthe ten ducats, whence I draw the inference that in\r\nEngland, just as with us, there are idle talkers who\r\nprove false to their word. I do not at all blame\r\nyou in this matter. I have not heard a syllable\r\nfrom Neate; so I do wish you would ask him\r\nwhether he has disposed of the F minor Concerto.\r\nI am almost ashamed to allude to the other works I\r\nintrusted to him, and equally so of myself, for having\r\ngiven them to him so confidingly, devoid of all\r\nconditions save those suggested by his own friendship\r\nand zeal for my interests.\nA translation has been sent to me of an article\r\nin the "Morning Chronicle" on the performance\r\nof the Symphony. Probably it will be the same as\r\nto this and all the other works Neate took with\r\nhim as with the "Battle Symphony;" the only\r\nprofit I shall derive will be reading a notice of their\r\nperformance in the newspapers.\n1816.\nMY WORTHY G.,--\nI beg you will send Carl to me with the bearer\r\nof this letter; otherwise I shall not be able to see\r\nhim all day, which would be contrary to his own\r\ninterest, as my influence seems to be required; in\r\nthe same view, I beg you will give him a few lines\r\nwith a report of his conduct, so that I may enter\r\nat once on any point where improvement is necessary.\nI am going to the country to-day, and shall not\r\nreturn till rather late at night; being always unwilling\r\nto infringe your rules, I beg you will send\r\nsome night-things with Carl, so that if we return\r\ntoo late to bring him to you to-day, I can keep him\r\nall night, and take him back to you myself early\r\nnext morning.\nIn haste, always yours,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\n1816.\nI must apologize to you, my good friend, for\r\nCarl having come home at so late an hour. We\r\nwere obliged to wait for a person who arrived so\r\nlate that it detained us, but I will not soon repeat\r\nthis breach of your rules. As to Carl\'s mother, I\r\nhave now decided that your wish not to see her\r\nagain in your house shall be acceded to. This\r\ncourse is far more safe and judicious for our dear\r\nCarl, experience having taught me that every visit\r\nfrom his mother leaves a root of bitterness in the\r\nboy\'s heart, which may injure, but never can benefit\r\nhim. I shall strive to arrange occasional meetings\r\nat my house, which is likely to result in everything\r\nbeing entirely broken off with her. As we\r\nthoroughly agree on the subject of Carl\'s mother,\r\nwe can mutually decide on the mode of his education.\nYour true friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nVienna, July 11, 1816.\nYour kindness towards me induces me to hope\r\nthat you will not attribute to any selfish design on\r\nmy part the somewhat audacious (though only as to\r\nthe surprise) dedication annexed. The work[1] was\r\nwritten for Y.R.H., or rather, it owes its existence\r\nto you, and this the world (the musical world)\r\nought to know. I shall soon have the honor of\r\nwaiting on Y.R.H. in Baden. Notwithstanding\r\nall the efforts of my physician, who will not allow\r\nme to leave this, the weakness in my chest is no\r\nbetter, though my general health is improved. I\r\nhope to hear all that is cheering of your own health,\r\nabout which I am always so much interested.\n[K.]\n1816.\nReceived, March, 1816, of Mr. Robert Birchall,\r\nmusic-seller, 133 New Bond Street, London, the\r\nsum of one hundred and thirty gold Dutch ducats,\r\nvalue in English currency sixty-five pounds, for all\r\nmy copyright and interest, present and future,\r\nvested or contingent, or otherwise within the United\r\nkingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the four\r\nfollowing compositions or pieces of music composed\r\nor arranged by me, viz.:--\n1st.

It is only an experiment, and when it is\r\nactually carried out I shall beg you to fortify me\r\nby your advice, and also to permit Carl sometimes\r\nto visit your institution. I shall always feel the\r\nmost sincere gratitude to you, and never can forget\r\nyour solicitude, and the kind care of your excellent\r\nwife, which has fully equalled that of the best\r\nof mothers. I would send you at least four times\r\nthe sum I now do, if my position admitted of it;\r\nbut at all events I shall avail myself at a future and,\r\nI hope, a brighter day, of every opportunity to acknowledge\r\nand to do justice to the foundation you\r\nhave laid for the moral and physical good of my\r\nCarl. With regard to the "Queen of the Night,"\r\nour system must continue the same; and as Carl is\r\nabout to undergo an operation in your house which\r\nwill cause him to feel indisposed, and consequently\r\nmake him irritable and susceptible, you must be\r\nmore careful than ever to prevent her having access\r\nto him; otherwise she might easily contrive to\r\nrevive all those impressions in his mind which we\r\nare so anxious to avoid. What confidence can be\r\nplaced in any promise to reform on her part, the impertinent\r\nscrawl I enclose will best prove [in reference,\r\nno doubt, to an enclosed note]. I send it\r\nmerely to show you how fully I am justified in the\r\nprecautions I have already adopted with regard to\r\nher. On this occasion, however, I did not answer\r\nlike a Sarastro, but like a Sultan. I would gladly\r\nspare you the anxiety of the operation on Carl,\r\nbut as it must take place in your house, I beg you\r\nwill inform me of the outlay caused by the affair,\r\nand the expenses consequent on it, which I will\r\nthankfully repay. Now farewell! Say all that is\r\nkind from me to your dear children and your excellent\r\nwife, to whose continued care I commend\r\nmy Carl. I leave Vienna to-morrow at five o\'clock\r\nA.M., but shall frequently come in from Baden.\nEver, with sincere esteem, your\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nMdme. A.G. is requested to order several pairs\r\nof good linen drawers for Carl. I intrust Carl to\r\nher kindness, and entirely rely on her motherly\r\ncare.\nBaden, September 5, 1816.\nDEAR Z.,--\nI don\'t know whether you received a note that I\r\nrecently left on the threshold of your door, for the\r\ntime was too short to enable me to see you. I\r\nmust therefore repeat my request about another\r\nservant, as the conduct of my present one is such\r\nthat I cannot possibly keep him.[1] He was engaged\r\non the 25th of April, so on the 25th of September\r\nhe will have been five months with me, and he received\r\n50 florins on account. The money for his\r\nboots will be reckoned from the third month (in\r\nmy service), and from that time at the rate of 40\r\nflorins per annum; his livery also from the third\r\nmonth. From the very first I resolved not to keep\r\nhim, but delayed discharging him, as I wished to\r\nget back the value of my florins. In the mean time\r\nif I can procure another, I will let this one leave\r\nmy service on the 15th of the month, and also give\r\nhim 20 florins for boot money, and 5 florins a\r\nmonth for livery (both reckoned from the third\r\nmonth), making altogether 35 florins. I ought\r\ntherefore still to receive 15 florins, but these I am\r\nwilling to give up; in this way I shall at all events\r\nreceive some equivalent for my 50 florins. If you\r\ncan find a suitable person, I will give him 2 florins\r\na day while I am in Baden, and if he knows how\r\nto cook he can use my firewood in the kitchen. (I\r\nhave a kitchen, though I do not cook in it.) If\r\nnot, I will add a few kreutzers to his wages. As\r\nsoon as I am settled in Vienna, he shall have 40\r\nflorins a month, and board and livery as usual,\r\nreckoned from the third month in my service, like\r\nother servants. It would be a good thing if he\r\nunderstood a little tailoring. So now you have my\r\nproposals, and I beg for an answer by the 10th of\r\nthis month at the latest, that I may discharge my\r\npresent servant on the 2d, with the usual fortnight\'s\r\nwarning; otherwise I shall be obliged to\r\nkeep him for another month, and every moment I\r\nwish to get rid of him. As for the new one, you\r\nknow pretty well what I require,--good, steady\r\nconduct, a good character, and not to be of a bloodthirsty\r\nnature, that I may feel my life to be safe, as,\r\nfor the sake of various scamps in this world, I\r\nshould like to live a little longer. By the 10th,\r\ntherefore, I shall expect to hear from you on this\r\naffair. If you don\'t run restive, I will soon send\r\nyou my treatise on the four violoncello strings, very\r\nprofoundly handled; the first chapter devoted exclusively\r\nto entrails in general, the second to catgut\r\nin particular. I need scarcely give you any further\r\nwarnings, as you seem to be quite on your guard\r\nagainst wounds inflicted before certain fortresses.\r\nThe most profound peace everywhere prevails!!!\r\nFarewell, my good Zmesk\xc3\xa4llchen! I am, as ever,\r\nun povero musico and your friend,\nBEETHOVEN.\nN.B. I shall probably only require my new\r\nservant for some months, as, for the sake of my\r\nCarl, I must shortly engage a housekeeper.\nBaden, Sept. 6, 1816.\nMY WORTHY K.,--\nI send you herewith the receipt, according to\r\nyour request, and beg that you will kindly arrange\r\nthat I should have the money by the 1st October,\r\nand without any deduction, which has hitherto been\r\nthe case; I also particularly beg you will not assign\r\nthe money to Baron P. (I will tell you why when\r\nwe meet; for the present let this remain between\r\nourselves.) Send it either direct to myself, or, if\r\nit must come through another person, do not let it\r\nbe Baron P. It would be best for the future, as\r\nthe house-rent is paid here for the great house belonging\r\nto Kinsky, that my money should be paid\r\nat the same time. This is only my own idea.\r\nThe Terzet you heard of will soon be engraved,\r\nwhich is infinitely preferable to all written music;\r\nyou shall therefore receive an engraved copy, and\r\nlikewise some more of my unruly offspring. In the\r\nmean time I beg that you will see only what is\r\ntruly good in them, and look with an indulgent eye\r\non the human frailties of these poor innocents.\r\nBesides, I am full of cares, being in reality father\r\nto my late brother\'s child; indeed I might have\r\nushered into the world a second part of the "Flauto\r\nMagico," having also been brought into contact with\r\na "Queen of the Night." I embrace you from my\r\nheart, and hope soon in so far to succeed that you\r\nmay owe some thanks to my Muse. My dear,\r\nworthy Kauka, I ever am your truly attached\r\nfriend,\nBEETHOVEN.\nWhat would be the result were I to leave this,\r\nand indeed the kingdom of Austria altogether?\r\nWould the life-certificate, if signed by the authorities\r\nof a non-Austrian place, still be valid?\nA tergo.\nI beg you will let me know the postage all my\r\nletters have cost you.\nSunday, September 22, 1816.\nCertain things can never be fully expressed. Of\r\nthis nature are my feelings, and especially my\r\ngratitude, on hearing the details of the operation on\r\nCarl from you. You will excuse my attempting\r\neven remotely to shape these into words. I feel\r\ncertain, however, that you will not decline the\r\ntribute I gladly pay you; but I say no more.\r\nYou can easily imagine my anxiety to hear how\r\nmy dear son is going on; do not omit to give me\r\nyour exact address, that I may write to you direct.\r\nAfter you left this I wrote to Bernhard [Bernard],\r\nto make inquiries at your house, but have not yet\r\ngot an answer; so possibly you may have thought\r\nme a kind of half-reckless barbarian, as no doubt\r\nHerr B. has neglected to call on you, as well as to\r\nwrite to me. I can have no uneasiness about Carl\r\nwhen your admirable wife is with him: that is quite\r\nout of the question. You can well understand how\r\nmuch it grieves me not to be able to take part in\r\nthe sufferings of my Carl, and that I at least wish\r\nto hear frequently of his progress. As I have renounced\r\nsuch an unfeeling, unsympathizing friend\r\nas Herr B. [Bernard], I must have recourse to\r\nyour friendship and complaisance on this point also,\r\nand shall hope soon to receive a few lines from you.\r\nI beg to send my best regards and a thousand\r\nthanks to your admirable wife.\nIn haste, your\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nI wish you to express to Smetana [the surgeon]\r\nmy esteem and high consideration.\nIf you do not object, I beg you will allow Carl to\r\ncome to me with the bearer of this. I forgot, in\r\nmy haste, to say that all the love and goodness\r\nwhich Mdme. A.G. [Giannatasio] showed my\r\nCarl during his illness are inscribed in the list of\r\nmy obligations, and I hope one day to show that\r\nthey are ever present in my mind. Perhaps I may\r\nsee you to-day with Carl.\nIn haste, your sincere friend,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nI take the opportunity through J. Simrock to\r\nremind you of myself. I hope you received the\r\nengraving of me [by Letronne], and likewise the\r\nBohemian glass. When I next make a pilgrimage\r\nthrough Bohemia you shall have something more\r\nof the same kind. Farewell! You are a husband\r\nand a father; so am I, but without a wife.\r\nMy love to your dear ones--to our dear ones.\nYour friend,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nVienna, 1. Oct. 1816.\nMY DEAR SIR,--\nI have duly received the \xc2\xa35 and thought previously\r\nyou would non increase the number of\r\nEnglishmen neglecting their word and honor, as I\r\nhad the misfortune of meeting with two of this sort.\r\nIn replic to the other topics of your favor, I have no\r\nobjection to write variations according to your plan,\r\nand I hope you will not find \xc2\xa330 too much, the\r\nAccompaniment will be a Flute or Violin or a Violoncello;\r\nyou\'ll either decide it when you send me\r\nthe approbation of the price, or you\'ll leave it to\r\nme. I expect to receive the songs or poetry--the\r\nsooner the better, and you\'ll favor me also\r\nwith the probable number of Works of Variations\r\nyou are inclined to receive of me. The Sonata in\r\nG with the accompan\'t of a Violin to his Imperial\r\nHighnesse Archduke Rodolph of Austria--it is\r\nOp\'a 96. The Trio in Bb is dedicated to the same\r\nand is Op. 97. The Piano arrangement of the\r\nSymphony in A is dedicated to the Empress of the\r\nRussians--meaning the Wife of the Emp\'r Alexander--Op.\r\n98.\nConcerning the expences of copying and packing\r\nit is not possible to fix him before hand, they are at\r\nany rate not considerable, and you\'ll please to consider\r\nthat you have to deal with a man of honor,\r\nwho will not charge one 6p. more than he is charged\r\nfor himself. Messrs. Fries & Co. will account with\r\nMessrs. Coutts & Co.--The postage may be lessened\r\nas I have been told. I offer you of my\r\nWorks the following new ones. A Grand Sonata\r\nfor the Pianoforte alone \xc2\xa340. A Trio for the\r\nPiano with accomp\'t of Violin and Violoncello for\r\n\xc2\xa350. It is possible that somebody will offer you\r\nother works of mine to purchase, for ex. the score\r\nof the Grand Symphony in A.--With regard to\r\nthe arrangement of this Symphony for the Piano I\r\nbeg you not to forget that you are not to publish it\r\nuntil I have appointed the day of its publication\r\nhere in Vienna. This cannot be otherwise without\r\nmaking myself guilty of a dishonorable act--but\r\nthe Sonata with the Violin and the Trio in B fl.\r\nmay be published without any delay.\nWith all the new works, which you will have\r\nof me or which I offer you, it rests with you to\r\nname the day of their publication at your own\r\nchoice: I entreat you to honor me as soon as possible\r\nwith an answer having many ordres for compositions\r\nand that you may not be delayed. My address\r\nor direction is\nMonsieur Louis van Beethoven\r\nNo. 1055 & 1056 Sailerstette 3d. Stock. Vienna.\nYou may send your letter, if you please, direct\r\nto your most humble servant\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nOct. 24, 1816.\nWELL BORN, AND YET EVIL BORN! (AS WE ALL ARE!)\nWe are in Baden to-day, and intend to bring the\r\ncelebrated naturalist Ribini a collection of dead\r\nleaves. To-morrow we purpose paying you not\r\nonly a visit but a visitation.\nYour devoted\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nNovember, 1816.[1]\nI have been again much worse, so that I can only\r\nventure to go out a little in the daytime; I am,\r\nhowever, getting better, and hope now to have the\r\nhonor of waiting on Y.R.H. three times a week.\r\nMeanwhile, I have many and great cares in these\r\nterrible times (which surpass anything we have\r\never experienced), and which are further augmented\r\nby having become the father since last November\r\nof a poor orphan. All this tends to retard my entire\r\nrestoration to health. I wish Y.R.H. all\r\nimaginable good and happiness, and beg you will\r\ngraciously receive and not misinterpret\nYour, &c., &c.\r\n[K.]\nBEST!\r\nMOST AMIABLE!\r\nFIRST AND FOREMOST TURNER MEISTER OF EUROPE!\nThe bearer of this is a poor devil! (like many\r\nanother!!!) You could assist him by asking your\r\ngracious master whether he is disposed to purchase\r\none of his small but neat pianos. I also beg you\r\nwill recommend him to any of the Chamberlains\r\nor Adjutants of the Archduke Carl, to see whether\r\nit is possible that H.R.H. would buy one of these\r\ninstruments for his Duchess. We therefore request\r\nan introduction from the illustrious Turner Meister\r\nfor this poor devil[1] to the Chamberlains and Adjutants\r\nof the household.\nLikewise\r\n1\r\npoor devil,\r\n[K.] L. V. BEETHOVEN.\nNov. 16, 1816.\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--\nMy household seems about to make shipwreck,\r\nor something very like it. You know that I was\r\nduped into taking this house on false pretexts; besides,\r\nmy health does not seem likely to improve in\r\na hurry. To engage a tutor under such circumstances,\r\nwhose character and whose very exterior\r\neven are unknown to me, and thus to intrust my\r\nCarl\'s education to hap-hazard, is quite out of the\r\nquestion, no matter how great the sacrifices which\r\nI shall be again called on to make. I beg you,\r\ntherefore, to keep Carl for the ensuing quarter,\r\ncommencing on the 9th. I will in so far comply\r\nwith your proposal as to the cultivation of the\r\nscience of music, that Carl may come to me two or\r\nthree times a week, leaving you at six o\'clock in\r\nthe evening and staying with me till the following\r\nmorning, when he can return to you by eight\r\no\'clock. It would be too fatiguing for Carl to come\r\nevery day, and indeed too great an effort and tie\r\nfor me likewise, as the lessons must be given at the\r\nsame fixed hour.\nDuring this quarter we can discuss more minutely\r\nthe most suitable plan for Carl, taking into consideration\r\nboth his interests and my own. I must,\r\nalas! mention my own also in these times, which\r\nare daily getting worse. If your garden residence\r\nhad agreed with my health, everything might have\r\nbeen easily adjusted. With regard to my debt to\r\nyou for the present quarter, I beg you will be so\r\nobliging as to call on me, that I may discharge it;\r\nthe bearer of this has the good fortune to be endowed\r\nby Providence with a vast amount of stupidity,\r\nwhich I by no means grudge him the benefit\r\nof, provided others do not suffer by it. As to the\r\nremaining expenses incurred for Carl, either during\r\nhis illness or connected with it, I must, for a few\r\ndays only, request your indulgence, having great\r\ncalls on me at present from all quarters. I wish\r\nalso to know what fee I ought to give Smetana for\r\nthe successful operation he performed; were I rich,\r\nor not in the same sad position in which all are\r\nwho have linked their fate to this country (always\r\nexcepting Austrian usurers), I would make no\r\ninquiries on the subject; and I only wish you to\r\ngive me a rough estimate of the proper fee. Farewell!\r\nI cordially embrace you, and shall always\r\nlook on you as a friend of mine and of Carl\'s.\nI am, with esteem, your\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nThough I would gladly spare you all needless\r\ndisagreeable trouble, I cannot, unluckily, do so on\r\nthis occasion. Yesterday, in searching for some\r\npapers, I found this pile, which has been sent to\r\nme respecting Carl. I do not quite understand\r\nthem, and you would oblige me much by employing\r\nsome one to make out a regular statement of\r\nall your outlay for Carl, so that I may send for it\r\nto-morrow. I hope you did not misunderstand me\r\nwhen I yesterday alluded to magnanimity, which\r\ncertainly was not meant for you, but solely for the\r\n"Queen of the Night," who is never weary of\r\nhoisting the sails of her vindictiveness against me;\r\nso on this account I require vouchers, more for the\r\nsatisfaction of others than for her sake (as I never\r\nwill submit to render her any account of my actions).\r\nNo stamp is required, and the sum alone\r\nfor each quarter need be specified, for I believe\r\nmost of the accounts are forthcoming; so all you\r\nhave to do is to append them to your prospectus\r\n[the conclusion illegible].\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nNov. 14, 1816.\nMY GOOD FRIEND,--\nI beg you will allow Carl to come to me to-morrow,\r\nas it is the anniversary of his father\'s death\r\n[Nov. 15th], and we wish to visit his grave together.\r\nI shall probably come to fetch him between\r\ntwelve and one o\'clock. I wish to know\r\nthe effect of my treatment of Carl, after your recent\r\ncomplaints. In the mean time, it touched me\r\nexceedingly to find him so susceptible as to his\r\nhonor. Before we left your house I gave him\r\nsome hints on his want of industry, and while\r\nwalking together in a graver mood than usual, he\r\npressed my hand vehemently, but met with no response\r\nfrom me. At dinner he scarcely eat anything,\r\nand said that he felt very melancholy, the\r\ncause of which I could not extract from him. At\r\nlast, in the course of our walk, he owned that he\r\nwas vexed because he had not been so industrious\r\nas usual. I said what I ought on the subject, but\r\nin a kinder manner than before. This, however,\r\nproves a certain delicacy of feeling, and such traits\r\nlead me to augur all that is good. If I cannot\r\ncome to you to-morrow, I hope you will let me\r\nknow by a few lines the result of my conference\r\nwith Carl.\nI once more beg you to let me have the account\r\ndue for the last quarter. I thought that you had\r\nmisunderstood my letter, or even worse than that.\r\nI warmly commend my poor orphan to your good\r\nheart, and, with kind regards to all, I remain\nYour friend,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nMY GOOD FRIEND,--\nPray forgive me for having allowed the enclosed\r\nsum to be ready for you during the last twelve days\r\nor more, and not having sent it. I have been very\r\nmuch occupied, and am only beginning to recover,\r\nthough indeed the word recovery has not yet been\r\npronounced.\nIn haste, with much esteem, ever yours,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nSIR,--\nIt is certainly of some moment to me not to appear\r\nin a false light, which must account for the accompanying\r\nstatement being so prolix. As to the\r\nfuture system of education, I can at all events congratulate\r\nmyself on having done all that I could\r\npossibly effect at present for the best, and trust that\r\nthe future may be in accordance with it. But if the\r\nwelfare of my nephew demands a change, I shall be\r\nthe first not only to propose such a step, but to\r\ncarry it out. I am no self-interested guardian, but I\r\nwish to establish a new monument to my name\r\nthrough my nephew. I have no need of my nephew,\r\nbut he has need of me. Idle talk and calumnies are\r\nbeneath the dignity of a man with proper self-respect,\r\nand what can be said when these extend even\r\nto the subject of linen!!! This might cause me\r\ngreat annoyance, but a just man ought to be able to\r\nbear injustice without in the most remote degree deviating\r\nfrom the path of right. In this conviction I\r\nwill stand fast, and nothing shall make me flinch.\r\nTo deprive me of my nephew would indeed entail a\r\nheavy responsibility. As a matter of policy as well\r\nas of morality, such a step would be productive of\r\nevil results to my nephew. I urgently recommend\r\nhis interests to you. As for me, my actions for his\r\nbenefit (not for my own) must speak for me.\nI remain, with esteem,\r\nYour obedient\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nBeing very busy, and rather indisposed, I must\r\nclaim your indulgence for the writing of the memorial.\nVienna 14. December 1816--1055 Sailerstette.\nDEAR SIR,--\nI give you my word of honor that I have signed\r\nand delivered the receipt to the home Fries and Co.\r\nsome day last August, who as they say have transmitted\r\nit to Messrs. Coutts and Co. where you\'ll\r\nhave the goodness to apply. Some error might\r\nhave taken place that instead of Messrs. C. sending\r\nit to you they have been directed to keep it till\r\nfetched. Excuse this irregularity, but it is not my\r\nfault, nor had I ever the idea of withholding it from\r\nthe circumstance of the \xc2\xa35 not being included.\r\nShould the receipt not come forth as Messrs. C., I\r\nam ready to sign any other, and you shall have it\r\ndirectly with return of post.\nIf you find Variations--in my style--too dear\r\nat \xc2\xa330, I will abate for the sake of your friendship\r\none third--and you have the offer of such Variations\r\nas fixed in our former lettres for \xc2\xa320 each\r\nAir.\nPlease to publish the Symphony in A immediately--as\r\nwell as the Sonata--and the Trio--they\r\nbeing ready here. The Grand Opera Fidelio\r\nis my work. The arrangement for the Pianoforte\r\nhas been published here under my care, but the\r\nscore of the Opera itself is not yet published. I\r\nhave given a copy of the score to Mr. Neate under\r\nthe seal of friendship and whom I shall direct to\r\ntreat for my account in case an offer should present.\nI anxiously hope your health is improving, give\r\nme leave to subscrive myself\nDear Sir\r\nYour very obedient Serv.\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nDec. 16, 1816.\nWith this, dear Zmeskall, you will receive my\r\nfriendly dedication [a stringed quartet, Op. 95],\r\nwhich may, I hope, serve as a pleasant memorial\r\nof our long-enduring friendship here; pray accept\r\nit as a proof of my esteem, and not merely as the\r\nextreme end of a thread long since spun out (for\r\nyou are one of my earliest friends in Vienna).\nFarewell! Beware of mouldering fortresses! for\r\nan attack on them will be more trying than on\r\nthose in a better state of preservation! As ever,\nYour friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nN.B. When you have a moment\'s leisure, let\r\nme know the probable cost of a livery, without\r\nlinen, but including hat and boots. Strange\r\nchanges have come to pass in my house. The man\r\nis off to the devil, I am thankful to say, whereas his\r\nwife seems the more resolved to take root here.\nDec. 28, 1816.\nN---- ought to have given you the New Year\'s\r\ntickets yesterday, but it seems she did not do so.\r\nThe day before I was occupied with Maelzel, whose\r\nbusiness was pressing, as he leaves this so soon;\r\notherwise you may be sure that I would have hurried\r\nup again to see you. Your dear kind daughter\r\nwas with me yesterday, but I scarcely ever remember\r\nbeing so ill; my precious servants were occupied\r\nfrom seven o\'clock till ten at night in trying to heat\r\nthe stove. The bitter cold, particularly in my room,\r\ncaused me a chill, and the whole of yesterday I\r\ncould scarcely move a limb. All day I was coughing,\r\nand had the most severe headache I ever had\r\nin my life; so by six o\'clock in the evening I was\r\nobliged to go to bed, where I still am, though feeling\r\nsomewhat better. Your brother dined with me\r\nyesterday, and has shown me great kindness. You\r\nare aware that on the same day, the 27th of December,\r\nI discharged B. [Baberl]. I cannot endure\r\neither of these vile creatures; I wonder if Nany\r\nwill behave rather better from the departure of her\r\ncolleague? I doubt it--but in that case I shall\r\nsend her packing without any ceremony. She is\r\ntoo uneducated for a housekeeper, indeed quite a\r\nbeast; but the other, in spite of her pretty face, is\r\neven lower than the beasts. As the New Year\r\ndraws near, I think five florins will be enough for\r\nNany; I have not paid her the charge for making\r\nher spencer, on account of her bad behavior to you.\r\nThe other certainly deserves no New Year\'s gift;\r\nbesides, she has nine florins of mine on hand, and\r\nwhen she leaves I don\'t expect to receive more\r\nthan four or five florins of that sum. I wish to\r\nhave your opinion about all this. Pray accept my\r\nbest wishes for your welfare, which are offered in\r\nall sincerity. I am your debtor in so many ways,\r\nthat I really often feel quite ashamed. Farewell;\r\nI trust I may always retain your friendship.\nNow, as ever, your friend,\r\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nI thank you for the interest you take in me. I\r\nam rather better, though to-day again I have been\r\nobliged to endure a great deal from Nany; but I\r\nshied half a dozen books at her head by way of a\r\nNew Year\'s gift. We have stripped off the leaves\r\n(by sending off Baberl) and lopped off the branches,\r\nbut we must extirpate the roots, till nothing is left\r\nbut the actual soil.\nNany is not strictly honest, and an odiously stupid\r\nanimal into the bargain. Such people must be\r\nmanaged not by love but by fear. I now see this\r\nclearly. Her account-book alone cannot show you\r\neverything clearly; you must often drop in unexpectedly\r\nat dinner-time, like an avenging angel, to\r\nsee with your own eyes what we actually have. I\r\nnever dine at home now, unless I have some friend\r\nas my guest, for I have no wish to pay as much for\r\none person as would serve for four. I shall now\r\nsoon have my dear son Carl with me, so economy\r\nis more necessary than ever. I cannot prevail on\r\nmyself to go to you; I know you will forgive this.\r\nI am very sensitive, and not used to such things, so\r\nthe less ought I to expose myself to them. In addition\r\nto twelve kreutzers for bread, Nany has a roll\r\nof white bread every morning. Is this usual?--and\r\nit is the same with the cook. A daily roll for\r\nbreakfast comes to eighteen florins a year. Farewell,\r\nand work well for me. Mdlle. Nany is wonderfully\r\nchanged for the better since I sent the\r\nhalf-dozen books at her head. Probably they\r\nchanced to come in collision with her dull brain or\r\nher bad heart; at all events, she now plays the\r\npart of a penitent swindler!!!\nIn haste, yours,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nNany yesterday took me to task in the vulgar\r\nmanner usual with people of her low class, about\r\nmy complaining to you; so she evidently knew that\r\nI had written to you on the subject. All the devilry\r\nbegan again yesterday morning, but I made\r\nshort work of it by throwing the heavy arm-chair\r\nbeside my bed at B.\'s head, which procured me\r\npeace for the rest of the day. They always take\r\ntheir revenge on me when I write to you, or when\r\nthey discover any communication between us.\nI do thank Heaven that I everywhere find men\r\nwho interest themselves in me; one of the most\r\ndistinguished Professors in this University has in\r\nthe kindest manner undertaken all that concerns\r\nCarl\'s education. If you happen to meet any of\r\nthe Giannatasios at Czerny\'s, you had better know\r\nnothing of what is going on about Carl, and say that\r\nit is contrary to my usual habit to disclose my plans,\r\nas when a project is told to others it is no longer exclusively\r\nyour own. They would like to interfere\r\nin the matter, and I do not choose that these commonplace\r\npeople should do so, both for my own sake\r\nand Carl\'s. Over their portico is inscribed, in\r\ngolden letters, "Educational Institution," whereas\r\n"Non-Educational Institution" would be more appropriate.\nAs for the servants, there is only one voice about\r\ntheir immorality, to which all the other annoyances\r\nhere may be ascribed.\nPray receive my benediction in place of that of\r\nthe Klosterneuburgers.[1]\nIn haste, your friend,\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nJudgment was executed to-day on the notorious\r\ncriminal! She bore it nearly in the same spirit as\r\nCaesar did Brutus\'s dagger, except that in the former\r\ncase truth formed the basis, while in hers only\r\nwicked malice. The kitchen-maid seems more\r\nhandy than the former ill-conducted beauty; she no\r\nlonger shows herself,--a sign that she does not expect\r\na good character from me, though I really had\r\nsome thoughts of giving her one. The kitchen-maid\r\nat first made rather a wry face about carrying\r\nwood, &c.\nLast day of December, 1816.\nI have been again obliged to keep my room ever\r\nsince the Burgher concert,[1] and some time must\r\nno doubt elapse before I shall be able to dismiss all\r\nprecautions as to my health. The year is about to\r\nclose; and with this new year my warmest wishes\r\nare renewed for the welfare of Y.R.H.; but\r\nindeed these have neither beginning nor end with\r\nme, for every day I cherish the same aspirations\r\nfor Y.R.H. If I may venture to add a wish for\r\nmyself to the foregoing, it is, that I may daily thrive\r\nand prosper more in Y.R.H.\'s good graces. The\r\nmaster will always strive not to be unworthy of the\r\nfavor of his illustrious master and pupil.\n[K.]\n... As to his mother, she urgently requested to\r\nsee Carl in my house. You have sometimes seen\r\nme tempted to place more confidence in her, and\r\nmy feelings would lead me to guard against harshness\r\ntowards her, especially as it is not in her power\r\nto injure Carl. But you may well imagine that to\r\none usually so independent of others, the annoyances\r\nto which I am exposed through Carl are often\r\nutterly insupportable, and above all with regard to\r\nhis mother; I am only too glad to hear nothing of\r\nher, which is the cause of my avoiding her name.\r\nWith respect to Carl, I beg you will enforce the\r\nstrictest discipline on him, and if he refuses to obey\r\nyour orders or to do his duty, I trust you will at\r\nonce punish him. Treat him as if he were your\r\nown child rather than a mere pupil, for I already\r\ntold you that during his father\'s lifetime he only\r\nsubmitted to the discipline of blows, which was a\r\nbad system; still, such was the fact, and we must\r\nnot forget it.\nIf you do not see much of me, pray ascribe it\r\nsolely to the little inclination I have for society,\r\nwhich is sometimes more developed and sometimes\r\nless; and this you might attribute to a change in\r\nmy feelings, but it is not so. What is good alone\r\nlives in my memory, and not what is painful. Pray\r\nimpute therefore solely to these hard times my not\r\nmore practically showing my gratitude to you on\r\naccount of Carl. God, however, directs all things;\r\nso my position may undergo a favorable change,\r\nwhen I shall hasten to show you how truly I am,\r\nwith sincere esteem, your grateful friend,\nL. V. BEETHOVEN.\nI beg you will read this letter to Carl.\nCarl must be at H.B.\'s to-day before four\r\no\'clock; I must request you therefore to ask his\r\nprofessor to dismiss him at half-past three o\'clock;\r\nif this cannot be managed he must not go into\r\nschool at all. In the latter case, I will come myself\r\nand fetch him; in the former, I will meet him in the\r\npassage of the University. To avoid all confusion,\r\nI beg for an explicit answer as to what you settle.\r\nAs you have been loudly accused of showing great\r\nparty feeling, I will take Carl myself. If you do\r\nnot see me, attribute it to my distress of mind, for\r\nI am now only beginning to feel the full force of\r\nthis terrible incident.[1]\nIn haste, your\r\nBEETHOVEN.\nThe assertions of this wicked woman have made\r\nsuch a painful impression on me, that I cannot possibly\r\nanswer every point to-day; to-morrow you\r\nshall have a detailed account of it all; but on no\r\npretext whatever allow her to have access to Carl,\r\nand adhere to your rule that she is only to see him\r\nonce a month. As she has been once this month\r\nalready, she cannot come again till the next.\nIn haste, your\r\nBEETHOVEN.\n1817.\nSIR,--\nI sincerely rejoice that we take the same view as\r\nto the terms in use to denote the proper time in\r\nmusic which have descended to us from barbarous\r\ntimes. For example, what can be more irrational\r\nthan the general term allegro, which only means\r\nlively; and how far we often are from comprehending\r\nthe real time, so that the piece itself contradicts\r\nthe designation. As for the four chief movements,--which\r\nare, indeed, far from possessing the truth\r\nor accuracy of the four cardinal points,--we readily\r\nagree to dispense with them, but it is quite another\r\nmatter as to the words that indicate the character\r\nof the music; these we cannot consent to do away\r\nwith, for while the time is, as it were, part and\r\nparcel of the piece, the words denote the spirit in\r\nwhich it is conceived.\nSo far as I am myself concerned, I have long purposed\r\ngiving up those inconsistent terms allegro,\r\nandante, adagio, and presto; and Maelzel\'s metronome\r\nfurnishes us with the best opportunity of\r\ndoing so. I here pledge myself no longer to make\r\nuse of them in any of my new compositions. It is\r\nanother question whether we can by this means attain\r\nthe necessary universal use of the metronome.\r\nI scarcely think we shall! I make no doubt that\r\nwe shall be loudly proclaimed as despots; but if the\r\ncause itself were to derive benefit from this, it\r\nwould at least be better than to incur the reproach\r\nof Feudalism! In our country, where music has\r\nbecome a national requirement, and where the use\r\nof the metronome must be enjoined on every\r\nvillage schoolmaster, the best plan would be for\r\nMaelzel to endeavor to sell a certain number of\r\nmetronomes by subscription, at the present higher\r\nprices, and as soon as the number covers his expenses,\r\nhe can sell the metronomes demanded by\r\nthe national requirements at so cheap a rate, that\r\nwe may certainly anticipate their universal use and\r\ncirculation. Of course some persons must take the\r\nlead in giving an impetus to the undertaking. You\r\nmay safely rely on my doing what is in my power,\r\nand I shall be glad to hear what post you mean to\r\nassign to me in the affair.\nI am, sir, with esteem, your obedient\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\nHIGHEST BORN! MOST ADMIRABLE! AND MARVELLOUS LIEUTENANT-GENERAL![1]\nWe beg you to give us bank-notes for twenty-four\r\ngold ducats at yesterday\'s rate of exchange,\r\nand to send them to us this evening or to-morrow,\r\nin order that we may forthwith remit and transmit\r\nthem. I should be glad and happy if your trustworthy\r\nAdjutant were to bring me these, as I have\r\nsomething particular to say to him. He must forget\r\nall his resentment, like a good Christian; we\r\nacknowledge his merits and do not contest his demerits.\r\nIn short, and once for all, we wish to see\r\nhim. This evening would suit us best.\nWe have the honor to remain, most astounding\r\nLieutenant-General! your devoted\nGENERALISSIMUS.\nPUBLICANDUM,--\nAfter due consideration, and by the advice of\r\nour Council, we have determined and decreed that\r\nhenceforth on all our works published with German\r\ntitles, the word Pianoforte is to be replaced by that\r\nof Hammer Clavier, and our worthy Lieutenant-General,\r\nhis Adjutant, and all whom it may concern,\r\nare charged with the execution of this order.\nInstead of Pianoforte--Hammer Clavier.\nSuch is our will and pleasure.\nGiven on the 23d of January, 1817, by the\r\nGeneralissimus.\nManu propria.\nThe following dedication occurred to me of my\r\nnew Sonata:--\n\r\n         "Sonata for the Pianoforte,\r\n                     or\nHammer Clavier.\r\nComposed and dedicated to Frau Baronin Dorothea\r\n            Ertmann--n\xc3\xa9e Graumann,\r\n                     by\r\n            Ludwig van Beethoven."\r\n\nIf the title is already engraved, I have the two\r\nfollowing proposals to make; viz., that I pay for\r\none title--I mean that it should be at my expense,\r\nor reserved for another new sonata of mine, for\r\nwhich purpose the mines of the Lieutenant-General\r\n(or pleno titulo, Lieutenant-General and First Councillor\r\nof State) must be opened to usher it into the\r\nlight of day; the title to be previously shown to\r\na good linguist. Hammer Clavier is certainly German,\r\nand so is the device. Honor to whom honor\r\nis due! How is it, then, that I have as yet received\r\nno reports of the carrying out of my orders,\r\nwhich, however, have no doubt been attended to?\nEver and always your attached\nAmicus\r\nad Amicum\r\nde Amico.\n\n\n\n\nN.B. I beg you will observe the most profound\r\nsilence about the dedication, as I wish it to be a\r\nsurprise!\nJan. 30, 1817.\nDEAR Z.,--\nYou seem to place me on a level with Schuppanzigh,\r\n&c., and have distorted the plain and simple\r\nmeaning of my words. You are not my debtor,\r\nbut I am yours, and now you make me so more than\r\never. I cannot express to you the pain your gift\r\nhas caused me, and I must candidly say that I cannot\r\ngive you one friendly glance in return. Although\r\nyou confine yourself to the practice of\r\nmusic, still you have often recourse to the power\r\nof imagination, and it seems to me that this not\r\nunfrequently leads to uncalled-for caprice on your\r\npart; at least, so it appeared to me from your letter\r\nafter my dedication. Loving as my sentiments\r\nare towards you, and much as I prize all your\r\ngoodness, still I feel provoked!--much provoked!--terribly\r\nprovoked!\nYour debtor afresh,\r\nWho will, however, contrive to have his revenge,\r\nL. VAN BEETHOVEN.\n'
