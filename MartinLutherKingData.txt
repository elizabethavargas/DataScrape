b'Our God is Marching On\nMy dear and abiding friends, Ralph Abernathy, and to all of the distinguished Americans seated here on the rostrum, my friends and co-workers of the state of Alabama, and to all of the freedom-loving people who have assembled here this afternoon from all over our nation and from all over the world: Last Sunday, more than eight thousand of us started on a mighty walk from Selma, Alabama. We have walked through desolate valleys and across the trying hills. We have walked on meandering highways and rested our bodies on rocky byways. Some of our faces are burned from the outpourings of the sweltering sun. Some have literally slept in the mud. We have been drenched by the rains. Our bodies are tired and our feet are somewhat sore.\nBut today as I stand before you and think back over that great march, I can say, as Sister Pollard said\xe2\x80\x94a seventy-year-old Negro woman who lived in this community during the bus boycott\xe2\x80\x94and one day, she was asked while walking if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to ride. And when she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the person said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you tired?\xe2\x80\x9d And with her ungrammatical profundity, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy feets is tired, but my soul is rested.\xe2\x80\x9d And in a real sense this afternoon, we can say that our feet are tired, but our souls are rested.\nThey told us we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get here. And there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies, but all the world today knows that we are here and we are standing before the forces of power in the state of Alabama saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 let nobody turn us around.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow it is not an accident that one of the great marches of American history should terminate in Montgomery, Alabama. Just ten years ago, in this very city, a new philosophy was born of the Negro struggle. Montgomery was the first city in the South in which the entire Negro community united and squarely faced its age-old oppressors. Out of this struggle, more than bus [de]segregation was won; a new idea, more powerful than guns or clubs was born. Negroes took it and carried it across the South in epic battles that electrified the nation and the world.\nYet, strangely, the climactic conflicts always were fought and won on Alabama soil. After Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s, heroic confrontations loomed up in Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, and elsewhere. But not until the colossus of segregation was challenged in Birmingham did the conscience of America begin to bleed. White America was profoundly aroused by Birmingham because it witnessed the whole community of Negroes facing terror and brutality with majestic scorn and heroic courage. And from the wells of this democratic spirit, the nation finally forced Congress to write legislation in the hope that it would eradicate the stain of Birmingham. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 gave Negroes some part of their rightful dignity, (Speak, sir) but without the vote it was dignity without strength.\xc2\xa0\nOnce more the method of nonviolent resistance was unsheathed from its scabbard, and once again an entire community was mobilized to confront the adversary. And again the brutality of a dying order shrieks across the land. Yet, Selma, Alabama, became a shining moment in the conscience of man. If the worst in American life lurked in its dark streets, the best of American instincts arose passionately from across the nation to overcome it. There never was a moment in American history more honorable and more inspiring than the pilgrimage of clergymen and laymen of every race and faith pouring into Selma to face danger at the side of its embattled Negroes.\nThe confrontation of good and evil compressed in the tiny community of Selma generated the massive power to turn the whole nation to a new course. A president born in the South had the sensitivity to feel the will of the country, and in an address that will live in history as one of the most passionate pleas for human rights ever made by a president of our nation, he pledged the might of the federal government to cast off the centuries-old blight. President Johnson rightly praised the courage of the Negro for awakening the conscience of the nation.\nOn our part we must pay our profound respects to the white Americans who cherish their democratic traditions over the ugly customs and privileges of generations and come forth boldly to join hands with us. From Montgomery to Birmingham, from Birmingham to Selma, from Selma back to Montgomery, a trail wound in a circle long and often bloody, yet it has become a highway up from darkness. Alabama has tried to nurture and defend evil, but evil is choking to death in the dusty roads and streets of this state. So I stand before you this afternoon with the conviction that segregation is on its deathbed in Alabama, and the only thing uncertain about it is how costly the segregationists and Wallace will make the funeral.\nOur whole campaign in Alabama has been centered around the right to vote. In focusing the attention of the nation and the world today on the flagrant denial of the right to vote, we are exposing the very origin, the root cause, of racial segregation in the Southland. Racial segregation as a way of life did not come about as a natural result of hatred between the races immediately after the Civil War. There were no laws segregating the races then. And as the noted historian, C. Vann Woodward, in his book,\xc2\xa0The Strange Career of Jim Crow, clearly points out, the segregation of the races was really a political stratagem employed by the emerging Bourbon interests in the South to keep the southern masses divided and southern labor the cheapest in the land. You see, it was a simple thing to keep the poor white masses working for near-starvation wages in the years that followed the Civil War. Why, if the poor white plantation or mill worker became dissatisfied with his low wages, the plantation or mill owner would merely threaten to fire him and hire former Negro slaves and pay him even less. Thus, the southern wage level was kept almost unbearably low.\nOur whole campaign in Alabama has been centered around the right to vote.

Why, if the poor white plantation or mill worker became dissatisfied with his low wages, the plantation or mill owner would merely threaten to fire him and hire former Negro slaves and pay him even less. Thus, the southern wage level was kept almost unbearably low.\nToward the end of the Reconstruction era, something very significant happened. That is what was known as the Populist Movement. The leaders of this movement began awakening the poor white masses and the former Negro slaves to the fact that they were being fleeced by the emerging Bourbon interests. Not only that, but they began uniting the Negro and white masses into a voting bloc that threatened to drive the Bourbon interests from the command posts of political power in the South.\nTo meet this threat, the southern aristocracy began immediately to engineer this development of a segregated society. I want you to follow me through here because this is very important to see the roots of racism and the denial of the right to vote. Through their control of mass media, they revised the doctrine of white supremacy. They saturated the thinking of the poor white masses with it, thus clouding their minds to the real issue involved in the Populist Movement. They then directed the placement on the books of the South of laws that made it a crime for Negroes and whites to come together as equals at any level. And that did it. That crippled and eventually destroyed the Populist Movement of the nineteenth century.\nIf it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave the Negro Jesus, then it may be said of the Reconstruction era that the southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow. He gave him Jim Crow. And when his wrinkled stomach cried out for the food that his empty pockets could not provide, he ate Jim Crow, a psychological bird that told him that no matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man, better than the black man. And he ate Jim Crow. And when his undernourished children cried out for the necessities that his low wages could not provide, he showed them the Jim Crow signs on the buses and in the stores, on the streets and in the public buildings. And his children, too, learned to feed upon Jim Crow, their last outpost of psychological oblivion.\nThus, the threat of the free exercise of the ballot by the Negro and the white masses alike resulted in the establishment of a segregated society. They segregated southern money from the poor whites; they segregated southern mores from the rich whites; they segregated southern churches from Christianity; they segregated southern minds from honest thinking; and they segregated the Negro from everything. That\xe2\x80\x99s what happened when the Negro and white masses of the South threatened to unite and build a great society: a society of justice where none would pray upon the weakness of others; a society of plenty where greed and poverty would be done away; a society of brotherhood where every man would respect the dignity and worth of human personality.\xc2\xa0\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way since that travesty of justice was perpetrated upon the American mind. James Weldon Johnson put it eloquently. He said:\nWe have come over a way\nThat with tears hath been watered.\xc2\xa0\nWe have come treading our paths\nThrough the blood of the slaughtered.\xc2\xa0\nOut of the gloomy past,\nTill now we stand at last\nWhere the white gleam\nOf our bright star is cast.\xc2\xa0\nToday I want to tell the city of Selma, today I want to say to the state of Alabama, today I want to say to the people of America and the nations of the world, that we are not about to turn around. We are on the move now.\nYes, we are on the move and no wave of racism can stop us. We are on the move now. The burning of our churches will not deter us. The bombing of our homes will not dissuade us. We are on the move now. The beating and killing of our clergymen and young people will not divert us. We are on the move now. The wanton release of their known murderers would not discourage us. We are on the move now. Like an idea whose time has come,\xc2\xa0 not even the marching of mighty armies can halt us. We are moving to the land of freedom.\nLet us therefore continue our triumphant march to the realization of the American dream. Let us march on segregated housing until every ghetto or social and economic depression dissolves, and Negroes and whites live side by side in decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Let us march on segregated schools until every vestige of segregated and inferior education becomes a thing of the past, and Negroes and whites study side-by-side in the socially-healing context of the classroom.\nLet us march on poverty until no American parent has to skip a meal so that their children may eat. March on poverty until no starved man walks the streets of our cities and towns in search of jobs that do not exist. Let us march on poverty until wrinkled stomachs in Mississippi are filled, and the idle industries of Appalachia are realized and revitalized, and broken lives in sweltering ghettos are mended and remolded.\nLet us march on ballot boxes, march on ballot boxes until race-baiters disappear from the political arena.\nLet us march on ballot boxes until the salient misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs will be transformed into the calculated good deeds of orderly citizens.\nLet us march on ballot boxes until the Wallaces of our nation tremble away in silence.\nLet us march on ballot boxes until we send to our city councils, state legislatures, and the United States Congress, men who will not fear to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.\nLet us march on ballot boxes until brotherhood becomes more than a meaningless word in an opening prayer, but the order of the day on every legislative agenda.\nLet us march on ballot boxes until all over Alabama God\xe2\x80\x99s children will be able to walk the earth in decency and honor.\nThere is nothing wrong with marching in this sense. The Bible tells us that the mighty men of Joshua merely walked about the walled city of Jericho\xc2\xa0 and the barriers to freedom came tumbling down. I like that old Negro spiritual, \xe2\x80\x9cJoshua Fit the Battle of Jericho.\xe2\x80\x9d In its simple, yet colorful, depiction of that great moment in biblical history, it tells us that:\nJoshua fit the battle of Jericho,\xc2\xa0\nJoshua fit the battle of Jericho,\xc2\xa0\nAnd the walls come tumbling down.\nUp to the walls of Jericho they marched, spear in hand.\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo blow them ramhorns,\xe2\x80\x9d Joshua cried,\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Cause the battle am in my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nThese words I have given you just as they were given us by the unknown, long-dead, dark-skinned originator. Some now long-gone black bard bequeathed to posterity these words in ungrammatical form, yet with emphatic pertinence for all of us today.\nThe battle is in our hands. And we can answer with creative nonviolence the call to higher ground to which the new directions of our struggle summons us. The road ahead is not altogether a smooth one. There are no broad highways that lead us easily and inevitably to quick solutions. But we must keep going.\nIn the glow of the lamplight on my desk a few nights ago, I gazed again upon the wondrous sign of our times, full of hope and promise of the future. And I smiled to see in the newspaper photographs of many a decade ago, the faces so bright, so solemn, of our valiant heroes, the people of Montgomery. To this list may be added the names of all those\xc2\xa0 who have fought and, yes, died in the nonviolent army of our day: Medgar Evers, three civil rights workers in Mississippi last summer, William Moore, as has already been mentioned, the Reverend James Reeb, Jimmy Lee Jackson, and four little girls in the church of God in Birmingham on Sunday morning. (Yes, sir) But in spite of this, we must go on and be sure that they did not die in vain. The pattern of their feet as they walked through Jim Crow barriers in the great stride toward freedom is the thunder of the marching men of Joshua, and the world rocks beneath their tread.\nMy people, my people, listen. The battle is in our hands. The battle is in our hands in Mississippi and Alabama and all over the United States. I know there is a cry today in Alabama, we see it in numerous editorials: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will Martin Luther King, SCLC, SNCC, and all of these civil rights agitators and all of the white clergymen and labor leaders and students and others get out of our community and let Alabama return to normalcy?\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut I have a message that I would like to leave with Alabama this evening. That is exactly what we don\xe2\x80\x99t want, and we will not allow it to happen, for we know that it was normalcy in Marion that led to the brutal murder of Jimmy Lee Jackson. It was normalcy in Birmingham that led to the murder on Sunday morning of four beautiful, unoffending, innocent girls. It was normalcy on Highway 80 that led state troopers to use tear gas and horses and billy clubs against unarmed human beings who were simply marching for justice. It was normalcy by a cafe in Selma, Alabama, that led to the brutal beating of Reverend James Reeb.\nIt is normalcy all over our country which leaves the Negro perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of vast ocean of material prosperity. It is normalcy all over Alabama that prevents the Negro from becoming a registered voter. No, we will not allow Alabama to return to normalcy.\nThe only normalcy that we will settle for is the normalcy that recognizes the dignity and worth of all of God\xe2\x80\x99s children. The only normalcy that we will settle for is the normalcy that allows judgment to run down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream. The only normalcy that we will settle for is the normalcy of brotherhood, the normalcy of true peace, the normalcy of justice.\nAnd so as we go away this afternoon, let us go away more than ever before committed to this struggle and committed to nonviolence. I must admit to you that there are still some difficult days ahead. We are still in for a season of suffering in many of the black belt counties of Alabama, many areas of Mississippi, many areas of Louisiana. I must admit to you that there are still jail cells waiting for us, and dark and difficult moments. But if we will go on with the faith that nonviolence and its power can transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows, we will be able to change all of these conditions.\nAnd so I plead with you this afternoon as we go ahead: remain committed to nonviolence. Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man, but to win his friendship and understanding. We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience. And that will be a day not of the white man, not of the black man. That will be the day of man as man.\nI know you are asking today, \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will it take?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s asking, \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will prejudice blind the visions of men, darken their understanding, and drive bright-eyed wisdom from her sacred throne?\xe2\x80\x9d Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s asking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will wounded justice, lying prostrate on the streets of Selma and Birmingham and communities all over the South, be lifted from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of men?\xe2\x80\x9d Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s asking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will the radiant star of hope be plunged against the nocturnal bosom of this lonely night, plucked from weary souls with chains of fear and the manacles of death? How long will justice be crucified, and truth bear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nI come to say to you this afternoon, however difficult the moment, however frustrating the hour, it will not be long, because \xe2\x80\x9ctruth crushed to earth will rise again.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nHow long? Not long, because \xe2\x80\x9cno lie can live forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nHow long? Not long, because \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall reap what you sow.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHow long? Not long:\xc2\xa0\nTruth forever on the scaffold,\xc2\xa0\nWrong forever on the throne,\xc2\xa0\nYet that scaffold sways the future,\xc2\xa0\nAnd, behind the dim unknown,\nStandeth God within the shadow,\nKeeping watch above his own.\nHow long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\xc2\xa0\nHow long? Not long, because:\nMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;\xc2\xa0\nHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;\nHe has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;\nHis truth is marching on.\xc2\xa0\nHe has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;\xc2\xa0\nHe is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat.\xc2\xa0\nO, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant my feet!\nOur God is marching on.\xc2\xa0\nGlory, hallelujah!\xc2\xa0 Glory, hallelujah!\nGlory, hallelujah! Glory, hallelujah!\nHis truth is marching on.\nLetter to Coretta\nWritten October 26, 1960\nWhile in Atlanta serving as associate pastor of his father\xe2\x80\x99s church, Ebenezer, King wrote the following letter to Coretta Scott, whom he began dating during the spring of 1952. The letter refers to a trip Scott had possibly made to Atlanta in August to visit King\xe2\x80\x99s family.

I am at the State Prison in Reidsville which is about 230 miles from Atlanta. They picked me up from the DeKalb jail about 4 \xe2\x80\x990 clock this morning. I know this whole experience is very difficult for you to adjust to, especially in your condition of pregnancy, but as I said to you yesterday this is the cross that we must bear for the freedom of our people. So I urge you to be strong in in faith, and this will in turn strengthen me. I can assure you that it is extremely difficult for me to think of being away from you and my Yoki and Marty for four months, but I am asking God hourly to give me the power of endurance. I have the faith to believe that this excessive suffering that is now coming to our family will in some little way serve to make Atlanta a better city, Georgia a better state, and America a better country. Just how I do not yet know, but I have faith to believe it will. If I am correct then our suffering is not in vain.\xc2\xa0\nI understand that I can have visitors twice a month\xe2\x80\x94the second and fourth Sunday. However, I understand that everybody\xe2\x80\x94white and colored\xe2\x80\x94can have visitors this coming Sunday. I hope you can find some way to come down. I know it will be a terrible inconvenience in your condition, but I want to see you and the children very badly. Also ask Wyatt to come. There are some very urgent things that I will need to talk with him about.\xc2\xa0Pleas bring the following books to me: Stride Toward Freedom, Paul Tillich\xe2\x80\x99s Systematic Theology Vol 1&2, George Buttrick The Parables of Jesus E. S. Jones Mahatma Gandhi, Horns and Halo, a Bible, a Dictionary and my reference dictionary called Increasing your Word Power? This book is an old book in a red cover and it may be in the den or upstairs in one of my [strikeout illegible;] bags. Also bring the following sermons from my file: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Man\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Three Dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Death of Evil\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy could not we cast him out?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Jesus called A man A Fool\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe God Samaritan\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peril of the Sword\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOur God is Able\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLevels of Love\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLoving your enemies\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGod of the Lost\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98Vision of A world made New\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cKeep moving From this Mountain\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA Religion of Doing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLooking Beyond you circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d The Impassable Gulf\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLove for Action\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChrist The Center of our Faith\xe2\x80\x9d Some of these are in the file; others are on the desk.5 Also bring a radio.\nGive my best regards to all the family. Please ask them not to worry about me. I will adjust to whatever comes in terms of pain. Hope to see you Sunday.\nEternally yours,\nMartin\nLetter from Birmingham jail\n\xc2\xa0\nWhile confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling our present activities \xe2\x80\x9cunwise and untimely.\xe2\x80\x9d Seldom, if ever, do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all of the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would be engaged in little else in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I would like to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.\nI think I should give the reason for my being in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the argument of \xe2\x80\x9coutsiders coming in.\xe2\x80\x9d I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every Southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty-five affiliate organizations all across the South, one being the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Whenever necessary and possible, we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago our local affiliate here in Birmingham invited us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promises. So I am here, along with several members of my staff, because we were invited here. I am here because I have basic organizational ties here.\nBeyond this, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth-century prophets left their little villages and carried their \xe2\x80\x9cthus saith the Lord\xe2\x80\x9d far beyond the boundaries of their hometowns; and just as the Apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to practically every hamlet and city of the Greco-Roman world, I too am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular hometown. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.\nMoreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial \xe2\x80\x9coutside agitator\xe2\x80\x9d idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider.\nYou deplore the demonstrations that are presently taking place in Birmingham. But I am sorry that your statement did not express a similar concern for the conditions that brought the demonstrations into being. I am sure that each of you would want to go beyond the superficial social analyst who looks merely at effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. I would not hesitate to say that it is unfortunate that so-called demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham at this time, but I would say in more emphatic terms that it is even more unfortunate that the white power structure of this city left the Negro community with no other alternative.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices are alive, negotiation, self-purification, and direct action. We have gone through all of these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying of the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of police brutality is known in every section of this country. Its unjust treatment of Negroes in the courts is a notorious reality. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in this nation. These are the hard, brutal, and unbelievable facts. On the basis of them, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the political leaders consistently refused to engage in good-faith negotiation.\nThen came the opportunity last September to talk with some of the leaders of the economic community. In these negotiating sessions certain promises were made by the merchants, such as the promise to remove the humiliating racial signs from the stores. On the basis of these promises, Reverend Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to call a moratorium on any type of demonstration. As the weeks and months unfolded, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. The signs remained. As in so many experiences of the past, we were confronted with blasted hopes, and the dark shadow of a deep disappointment settled upon us. So we had no alternative except that of preparing for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and national community. We were not unmindful of the difficulties involved. So we decided to go through a process of self-purification. We\xc2\xa0started having workshops on nonviolence and repeatedly asked ourselves the questions, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you able to accept blows without retaliating?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAre you able to endure the ordeals of jail?\xe2\x80\x9d We decided to set our direct-action program around the Easter season, realizing that, with exception of Christmas, this was the largest shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this was the best time to bring pressure on the merchants for the needed changes. Then it occurred to us that the March election was ahead, and so we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that Mr. Conner was in the runoff, we decided again to postpone action so that the demonstration could not be used to cloud the issues. At this time we agreed to begin our nonviolent witness the day after the runoff.\nThis reveals that we did not move irresponsibly into direct action. We, too, wanted to see Mr. Conner defeated, so we went through postponement after postponement to aid in this community need. After this we felt that direct action could be delayed no longer.\nYou may well ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy direct action, why sit-ins, marches, and so forth? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t negotiation a better path?\xe2\x80\x9d You are exactly right in your call for negotiation. Indeed, this is the purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such creative tension that a community that has consistently refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. I just referred to the creation of tension as a part of the work of the nonviolent resister. This may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \xe2\x80\x9ctension.\xe2\x80\x9d I have earnestly worked and preached against violent tension, but there is a type of constructive nonviolent tension that is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must see the need of having nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men to rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. So, the purpose of direct action is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. We therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in the tragic attempt to live in monologue rather than dialogue.\nOne of the basic points in your statement is that our acts are untimely. Some have asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you give the new administration time to act?\xe2\x80\x9d The only answer that I can give to this inquiry is that the new administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one before it acts. We will be sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Mr. Boutwell will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is much more articulate and gentle than Mr. Conner, they are both segregationists, dedicated to the task of maintaining the status quo. The hope I see in Mr. Boutwell is that he will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from the devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals.\nWe know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct-action movement that was \xe2\x80\x9cwell timed\xe2\x80\x9d according to the timetable of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \xe2\x80\x9cwait.\xe2\x80\x9d It rings in the ear of every Negro with a piercing familiarity. This \xe2\x80\x9cwait\xe2\x80\x9d has almost always meant \xe2\x80\x9cnever.\xe2\x80\x9d It has been a tranquilizing thalidomide, relieving the emotional stress for a moment, only to give birth to an ill-formed infant of frustration. We must come to see with the distinguished jurist of yesterday that \xe2\x80\x9cjustice too long delayed is justice denied.\xe2\x80\x9d We have waited for more than three hundred and forty years for our God-given and constitutional rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward the goal of political independence, and we still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward the gaining of a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. I guess it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say \xe2\x80\x9cwait.\xe2\x80\x9d But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick, brutalize, and even kill your black brothers and sisters with impunity; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she cannot go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her little eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky, and see her begin to distort her little personality by unconsciously developing a bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son asking in agonizing pathos, \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?\xe2\x80\x9d; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccolored\xe2\x80\x9d; when your first name becomes \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d and your middle name becomes \xe2\x80\x9cboy\xe2\x80\x9d (however old you are) and your last name becomes \xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d and when your wife and mother are never given the respected title \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\xe2\x80\x9d; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never knowing what to expect next, and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \xe2\x80\x9cnobodyness\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.\n\xc2\xa0\nYou express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, it is rather strange and paradoxical to find us consciously breaking laws. One may well ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?\xe2\x80\x9d The answer is found in the fact that there are two types of laws: there are just laws, and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that \xe2\x80\x9cAn unjust law is no law at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine when a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law, or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas, an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. To use the words of Martin Buber, the great Jewish philosopher, segregation substitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x9d relationship for the \xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x93 thou\xe2\x80\x9d relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. So segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, but it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t segregation an existential expression of man\xe2\x80\x99s tragic separation, an expression of his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? So I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court because it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances because they are morally wrong.\nLet us turn to a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the other hand, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow, and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.\nLet me give another explanation. An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up the segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout the state of Alabama all types of conniving methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties without a single Negro registered to vote, despite the fact that the Negroes constitute a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be considered democratically structured?\nThese are just a few examples of unjust and just laws. There are some instances when a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I was arrested Friday on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong with an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade, but when the ordinance is used to preserve segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and peaceful protest, then it becomes unjust.\nOf course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was seen sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar because a higher moral law was involved. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks before submitting to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience.\nWe can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was \xe2\x80\x9cillegal.\xe2\x80\x9d It was \xe2\x80\x9cillegal\xe2\x80\x9d to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s Germany. But I am sure that if I had lived in Germany during that time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal. If I lived in a Communist country today where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I believe I would openly advocate disobeying these anti-religious laws.\n\xc2\xa0\nI must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, \xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t agree with your methods of direct action\xe2\x80\x9d; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man\xe2\x80\x99s freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a \xe2\x80\x9cmore convenient season.\xe2\x80\x9d Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\nIn your statement you asserted that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But can this assertion be logically made? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this like condemning the robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical delvings precipitated the misguided popular mind to make him drink the hemlock? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this like condemning Jesus because His unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to His will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see, as federal courts have consistently affirmed, that it is immoral to urge an individual to withdraw his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest precipitates violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber.\nI had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth of time. I received a letter this morning from a white brother in Texas which said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but is it possible that you are in too great of a religious hurry? It has taken Christianity almost 2000 years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.\xe2\x80\x9d All that is said here grows out of a tragic misconception of time. It is the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time is neutral. It can be used either destructively or constructively. I am coming to feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.\n\xc2\xa0\nYou spoke of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I started thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency made up of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, have been so completely drained of self-respect and a sense of \xe2\x80\x9csomebodyness\xe2\x80\x9d that they have adjusted to segregation, and, on the other hand, of a few Negroes in the middle class who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because at points they profit by segregation, have unconsciously become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred and comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up over the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim movement. This movement is nourished by the contemporary frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination. It is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incurable devil. I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need not follow the do-nothingism of the complacent or the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. There is a more excellent way, of love and nonviolent protest. I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful to God that, through the Negro church, the dimension of nonviolence entered our struggle. If this philosophy had not emerged, I am convinced that by now many streets of the South would be flowing with floods of blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as \xe2\x80\x9crabble-rousers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coutside agitators\xe2\x80\x9d those of us who are working through the channels of nonviolent direct action and refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes, out of frustration and despair, will seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies, a development that will lead inevitably to a frightening racial nightmare.\nOppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The urge for freedom will eventually come. This is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom; something without has reminded him that he can gain it. Consciously and unconsciously, he has been swept in by what the Germans call the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America, and the Caribbean, he is moving with a sense of cosmic urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. Recognizing this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand public demonstrations. The Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent frustrations. He has to get them out. So let him march sometime; let him have his prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; understand why he must have sit-ins and freedom rides. If his repressed emotions do not come out in these nonviolent ways, they will come out in ominous expressions of violence. This is not a threat; it is a fact of history. So I have not said to my people, \xe2\x80\x9cGet rid of your discontent.\xe2\x80\x9d But I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled through the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. Now this approach is being dismissed as extremist. I must admit that I was initially disappointed in being so categorized.\nBut as I continued to think about the matter, I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist. Was not Jesus an extremist in love? \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.\xe2\x80\x9d Was not Amos an extremist for justice? \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cLet justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\xe2\x80\x9d Was not Paul an extremist for the gospel of Jesus Christ? \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.\xe2\x80\x9d Was not Martin Luther an extremist? \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHere I stand; I can do no other so help me God.\xe2\x80\x9d Was not John Bunyan an extremist? \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a mockery of my conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d Was not Abraham Lincoln an extremist? \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThis nation cannot survive half slave and half free.\xe2\x80\x9d Was not Thomas Jefferson an extremist? \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\xe2\x80\x9d So the question is not whether we will be extremist, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate, or will we be extremists for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice, or will we be extremists for the cause of justice?\nI had hoped that the white moderate would see this. Maybe I was too optimistic. Maybe I expected too much. I guess I should have realized that few members of a race that has oppressed another race can understand or appreciate the deep groans and passionate yearnings of those that have been oppressed, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent, and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too small in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some, like Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, and James Dabbs, have written about our struggle in eloquent, prophetic, and understanding terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They sat in with us at lunch counters and rode in with us on the freedom rides. They have languished in filthy roach-infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of angry policemen who see them as \xe2\x80\x9cdirty nigger lovers.\xe2\x80\x9d They, unlike many of their moderate brothers, have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d antidotes to combat the disease of segregation.\n\xc2\xa0\nLet me rush on to mention my other disappointment. I have been disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand this past Sunday in welcoming Negroes to your Baptist Church worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Springhill College several years ago.\nBut despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say that as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say it as a minister of the gospel who loves the church, who was nurtured in its bosom, who has been sustained by its Spiritual blessings, and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.\nI had the strange feeling when I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery several years ago that we would have the support of the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests, and rabbis of the South would be some of our strongest allies. Instead, some few have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows.\nIn spite of my shattered dreams of the past, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and with deep moral concern serve as the channel through which our just grievances could get to the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed.\nI have heard numerous religious leaders of the South call upon their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers say, follow this decree because integration is morally right and the Negro is your brother. In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churches stand on the sidelines and merely mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard so many ministers say, \xe2\x80\x9cThose are social issues which the gospel has nothing to do with,\xe2\x80\x9d and I have watched so many churches commit themselves to a completely otherworldly religion which made a strange distinction between bodies and souls, the sacred and the secular.\nThere was a time when the church was very powerful. It was during that period that the early Christians rejoiced when they were deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was the thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Wherever the early Christians entered a town the power structure got disturbed and immediately sought to convict them for being \xe2\x80\x9cdisturbers of the peace\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coutside agitators.\xe2\x80\x9d But they went on with the conviction that they were \xe2\x80\x9ca colony of heaven\xe2\x80\x9d and had to obey God rather than man. They were small in number but big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be \xe2\x80\x9castronomically intimidated.\xe2\x80\x9d They brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contest.\nThings are different now. The contemporary church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. It is so often the arch supporter of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church\xe2\x80\x99s often vocal sanction of things as they are.\nBut the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If the church of today does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authentic ring, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. I meet young people every day whose disappointment with the church has risen to outright disgust.\nI hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are presently misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with the destiny of America. Before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson scratched across the pages of history the majestic word of the Declaration of Independence, we were here. For more than two centuries our foreparents labored here without wages; they made cotton king; and they built the homes of their masters in the midst of brutal injustice and shameful humiliation \xe2\x80\x94 and yet out of a bottomless vitality our people continue to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.\nI must close now. But before closing I am impelled to mention one other point in your statement that troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping \xe2\x80\x9corder\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpreventing violence.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its angry violent dogs literally biting six unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you would so quickly commend the policemen if you would observe their ugly and inhuman treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you would watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you would see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys, if you would observe them, as they did on two occasions, refusing to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that I can\xe2\x80\x99t join you in your praise for the police department.\nIt is true that they have been rather disciplined in their public handling of the demonstrators. In this sense they have been publicly \xe2\x80\x9cnonviolent.\xe2\x80\x9d But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the last few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. So I have tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or even more, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.\nI wish you had commended the Negro demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer, and their amazing discipline in the midst of the most inhuman provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, courageously and with a majestic sense of purpose facing jeering and hostile mobs and the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy-two-year-old woman of Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride the segregated buses, and responded to one who inquired about her tiredness with ungrammatical profundity, \xe2\x80\x9cMy feets is tired, but my soul is rested.\xe2\x80\x9d They will be young high school and college students, young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience\xe2\x80\x99s sake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for the best in the American dream and the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage.\nNever before have I written a letter this long \xe2\x80\x94 or should I say a book? I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else is there to do when you are alone for days in the dull monotony of a narrow jail cell other than write long letters, think strange thoughts, and pray long prayers?\nIf I have said anything in this letter that is an understatement of the truth and is indicative of an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything in this letter that is an overstatement of the truth and is indicative of my having a patience that makes me patient with anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.\n'
